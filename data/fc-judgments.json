Two features make this application unusual. <em>First</em>, unlike the typical relocation case, the applicant-mother will not reside with the son in the UK. Instead, she intends for him to reside at an English boarding school while she remains in Singapore. <em>Second</em>, she contends that the idea of boarding originated from the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The father opposes the application on two bases. <em>First</em>, a 12-year-old would not, on his own, propose attending an English boarding school. <em>Second</em>, the child is not sufficiently mature to understand the implications of living overseas without his parents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       When a parent seeks to relocate a child from Singapore, the court’s overriding concern is the child’s welfare and best interests: <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> (“<b><em>BNS</em></b>”) at [19]. Applying this principle, the question here is whether it will serve the 12-year-old’s welfare and best interests to relocate him to the UK to attend a boarding school while his parents remain in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The applicant-mother (“<b>Mother</b>”) and respondent-father (“<b>Father</b>”) are divorced. Their son was born in November 2013 (“<b>Son</b>”). Since 2022, the Mother has been the care-parent, while the Father has weekend access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       According to the Mother, the Son expressed, in early 2024, a desire to pursue secondary education abroad. She took his aspirations seriously: she conducted the relevant research, engaged educational specialists, and visited potential schools. She believes that she can fund the boarding education on her own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In September 2024, the Mother presented the overseas-study proposal to the Father. He opposed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In April 2025, an English boarding school (“<b>School</b>”) indicated that it could enrol the Son for the January 2026 intake, subject to the Father’s consent. The Father maintained his objection, thus resulting in the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overriding consideration</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As noted, the overriding consideration in relocation applications is the child’s welfare and best interests. This is the lens through which every other consideration is assessed. The assessment is an objective one. It eschews (a) any “pre-fixed precedence or hierarchy” among factors, (b) categorical pigeonholes that predetermine outcomes, and (c) presumption for or against relocation: <em>BNS</em> at [20] to [22]; <em>WRU v WRT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31510-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 23</a> (“<b><em>WRU</em></b>”) at [18]; <em>UYK v UYK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25444-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 772</a> (“<b><em>UYK</em></b>”) at [38]; <em>TAA v TAB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17369-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 879</a> (“<b><em>TAA</em></b>”) at [17]. Thus, neither a parent’s good intentions nor a child’s strong desire to live abroad is determinative. These are simply factors to be weighed against others in assessing whether relocation should be permitted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Analytical framework</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       What factors are relevant, and how do courts determine whether relocation serves a child’s welfare and best interests? The case law provides the following guidance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasons for relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The court first examines the reasons advanced for relocation, assessing whether they are genuine, rational, and coherent: <em>TAA</em> at [25] to [27]; <em>UXH v UXI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23882-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 24</a> (“<b><em>UXH</em></b>”) at [23]; <em>UYK</em> at [67] and [69]; <em>Liew Kah Heng v Kwok Fong Ee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/5105-M.xml')\">[2000] SGDC 7</a> at [18] and [19]. In general, applications aimed at diminishing the child’s relationship with the access-parent will be rejected: <em>BNT v BNS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/16727-SSP-M.xml')\">[2014] 4 SLR 859</a> (“<b><em>BNT</em></b>”) at [51] and [53]; <em>Re C (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 1 SLR(R) 0502.xml')\">[2003] 1 SLR(R) 502</a> (“<b><em>Re C</em></b>”) at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Impact of relocation on the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Next, the court considers the impact of relocation on the child: <em>Re C</em> at [17(a)]; <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a> at [26] and [27]; <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a> at [9] and [10]; <em>VTU v VTV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27401-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 598</a> at [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In assessing such impact, the court considers, among others –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The extent of the child’s integration in Singapore and his or her ability to adapt to change.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       For instance, relocation may be less disruptive for a child accustomed to moving with expatriate parents than for a child who has lived here since birth with Singaporean parents. Further, what may be manageable for a mature teenager can feel very different to a child in early adolescence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Apart from age, the court will also consider the child’s (1) personality, (2) physical, emotional, and educational needs, and (3) each parent’s capacity to meet those needs if relocation is granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The strength of the child’s attachment to his or her parents and other caregivers. <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [51] and [52]; <em>UXH</em> at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Distance can strain even the strongest of bonds. The court will scrutinise the applicant-parent’s willingness to sustain the child’s relationship with the respondent-parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       A history of cooperation between the parents may give confidence that contact will be facilitated. On the other hand, a pattern of high conflict points the other way and may call for the applicant-parent to provide clearer safeguards if relocation is to be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the applicant-parent has concrete plans to minimise the disruptions caused by relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>The court will assess whether the post-relocation environment will be stable or uncertain. Specifics matter. Vague, speculative, or hastily made unilateral plans are likely to count against relocation: <em>WRU</em> at [37]; <em>TAA</em> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The child’s views</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The child’s views are also important part. The weight to be accorded to such views depends on (a) the child’s age and maturity, (b) whether the views are supported by reasons, (c) whether the views have been held for a long time or a transient, (d) whether the child has been influenced or coached, and (e) whether the child understands the implications of the relocation: see e.g., <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a> (“<b><em>WKM</em></b>”) at [45(a)]; <em>AZB v AZC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18367-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHCF 1</a> at [15] and [25]; <em>ZO v ZP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0647.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 647</a> at [15] and [16]; s 125(2)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden and standard of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering all relevant factors, the court will then evaluate the two options: (a) permit relocation, or (b) maintain the status quo in Singapore. This evaluation involves two steps: <em>first</em>, identify the benefits and harms of each option; <em>second</em>, compare the options to determine which one better serves the child’s welfare and best interests in both the short and longer term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The parent seeking to uproot a child from a settled living arrangement bears the burden of proof. That parent must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the child’s overall welfare is better served by relocation than by remaining in Singapore. The question is not merely whether relocation offers advantages, but whether – <em>taken as a whole</em> – it is the better path for the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In assessing whether this burden is met, several points bear emphasis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The assessment is <em>forward-looking</em>: it considers not only what the child presently enjoys, but also what he or she stands to gain – or lose – by relocation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Given the high stakes, the court will <em>proceed with care</em>. For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Where the potential advantages are speculative and the risks of emotional or developmental harm are substantial, the proper course may be to remain in Singapore. This is especially so for younger, well-settled children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Where benefits and downsides are finely balanced, one option may be to defer relocation to a later stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Caution, however, does not equate to a default rule against relocation. Major changes to improve the quality and prospects of life will entail risk and uncertainty. What a court seeks to do is to avoid exposing the child to a level of risk from relocation that is <em>unreasonably high</em> when compared to (i) its potential gains and (ii) the risk from remaining in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I will now apply the above framework – grounded in the child’s welfare and interests – to the facts of this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasons for relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Mother believes that the School is aligned to the Son’s strengths and will develop his potential.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> She highlights that it has (a) a strong academic reputation, (b) wide co-curricular offerings that emphasise critical thinking, creativity, and leadership, and (c) won awards such as Co-Educational Independent School of the Year and Best Sports School in the UK.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Impact of relocation on the Son</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Nature and extent of impact</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Father, on the other hand, is concerned that the Son (a) is “far too young” to live overseas without a resident parent, (b) is not mature enough to cope with homesickness as well as social and academic pressures, and (c) may face challenges in re-integrating into Singapore in the future, including National Service.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Mother’s mitigation plan</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother contends that the Father’s concerns are “speculative”: She had (a) engaged an educational consultant, (b) visited the School,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and (c) chosen it because of its emphasis on pastoral care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In any event, to mitigate possible adjustment issues, she plans to (a) be in the UK during the first six months of the school term, (b) visit the Son regularly thereafter, (c) maintain frequent video, messaging, and phone contact, and (d) arrange for the child to return to Singapore during school holidays.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Son’s views</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I now come to the Son’s views. There is a dispute as to whether the boarding idea originated with him. To address this, I spoke with the child in chambers with a Court Family Specialist present.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Based on that conversation, I am satisfied the idea did originate from the child. He said that it arose after watching a TikTok video about the School. He spoke enthusiastically about its campus, facilities, and co-curricular opportunities. I accept that his wish is genuine and is not the product of coaching or pressure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Although the Son is keen to enrol in the School, I am unable to give it full weight. This is because he appears to lack the maturity to fully comprehend and manage the consequences of relocation. During my conversation with him, he held an unrealistically rosy view of boarding, saw virtually no downsides to the experience, and proposed simplistic coping strategies for homesickness, peer conflict, and academic pressure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In summary, while the Son genuinely wishes to enrol at the School, he has not fully grasped the challenges of boarding. His cognitive and critical-thinking skills are still developing. This is unsurprising as he is only 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Weighing the two options</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I now weigh the benefits and harms of the two options: permitting relocation (“<b>Option A</b>”) or the Son remaining in Singapore (“<b>Option B</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Option A</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I begin with Option A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I accept that the School is reputable and can offer the Son significant educational opportunities and international exposure. Boarding can also cultivate his independence and character.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, the potential downsides are serious and, in my view, outweigh the benefits. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Relocation typically entails (i) emotional strain (homesickness, anxiety), (ii) educational disruption (adjusting to a different system and challenges of eventual re-entry to the Singapore education system), (iii) social upheaval (leaving behind established relationships and building new ones), and (iv) other concerns (safety and stability of living arrangements).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the present case, the impact of relocation is likely to be magnified due to the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At 12, the Son is in early adolescence – a period of heightened emotional and psychological flux. Children at this age generally seek independence while at the same time rely heavily on physically present caregivers to buffer stress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The evidence shows that the Son (1) is closely attached to the Mother, (2) has limited experience in independently managing his wellbeing in Singapore, and (3) has travelled outside Asia only once (to visit the School and to France on the same trip). The child will face difficulties in communicating his adjustment issues to his loved ones in Singapore given the distance and time-zone differences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Further, the enrolment is proposed to take place in less than two months (January 2026). Such a sudden and substantial reduction in emotional support will increase the Son’s vulnerability to anxiety, loneliness, and adjustment difficulties. This is not a small step but a leap – to a new country, culture, independent living, and roommates. The absence of a resident parent in a boarding environment heightens the risk of the child’s emotional difficulties being undetected and unaddressed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Because neither parent would reside with the Son in the UK for a substantial period, I must scrutinise the Mother’s mitigation plan more closely. In this regard, she has failed to satisfy me that it adequately addresses the above concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Her plan relies heavily – after an initial six-month stay – on the School’s pastoral system and the child’s self-reporting. There is no detail on how early emotional or behavioural warning signs will be identified, escalated, and addressed if he struggles. Neither is there evidence of the School’s protocols to handle bullying.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In my view, the Mother’s proposal for regular virtual contact underestimates practical constraints of time zones and school schedules. While digital platforms help, they cannot substitute the warmth and immediacy of physical presence, especially for younger children. As observed in <em>BNT</em> at [35(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The facts of the children’s young ages and the difference in time zones between Canada and Singapore will make it difficult for their father to sustain the closeness of his present relationship with them. With younger children, closeness is promoted by physical contact and frequent interaction in routine activities. Telephone and internet access are frequently unsatisfactory due to technical difficulties and generally permit only one type of interaction: conversation. Normal family life consists of much more than conversations between parent and child – there are joint activities, routines, projects, discipline and learning from the examples set by the parents in all sorts of situations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There is also a real possibility that boarding may prove too much for the Son. A premature return to Singapore could bring further risks: (i) re-adjustment to the local syllabus, (ii) the burden of perceived “failure”, and (iii) guilt over having wasted funds and time – an onerous burden for a young child. The Mother has not dealt with these issues in her evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Instead, she submits that the Son is resilient and will adapt. As in <em>XBF v XBE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32437-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 42</a> at [16], I see no reason to test his resilience through a high impact move. There is no pressing need for boarding now – overseas education can still be considered when he is older.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At the hearing, the Mother’s counsel, for the first time, suggested that she might relocate to the UK so the Son would not be without a resident parent, and that this could be imposed as a condition for allowing the application. In my view, it is not appropriate to decide in favour of relocation based on this late oral suggestion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother had ample opportunity to run this suggestion as her primary case. She did not. Instead, her evidence proceeded on the basis that she would return to Singapore after six months, leaving the Son in the UK. Her financial and logistical planning reflects that premise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the suggestion lacks details. For instance, the Mother did not explain how she would obtain permission to work in the UK, how she would support herself and the Son, and how long such an arrangement could be sustained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, if the suggestion were to be given serious consideration, this would likely require fresh evidence from the Mother. This would prejudice the Father and prolong uncertainty for the Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For completeness, although not requested by the Mother, I have considered adjourning the matter to allow her to formulate a detailed plan to relocate with the Son. I eventually declined to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the School’s intake is imminent – less than two months away. An adjournment would lead to hurried proposals on life-shaping decisions. It would also create acute stress and uncertainty about the child’s immediate living and schooling arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, if, in future, the Mother develops a concrete plan to relocate with the child, she remains free to file a fresh application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Option B</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Next, I turn to Option B. This option preserves a stable home environment. From my conversation with the Son, it is evident that he has strong connections with the Mother and paternal grandparents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The potential downsides are that the child may view dismissal of the application as extinguishing his aspirations, feel frustrated, and blame the Father. These downsides are less serious than the risks under Option A. They can also be mitigated – he may revisit overseas education later, when he is more mature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     For completeness, there is no evidence that (a) the child has needs that cannot be met by Singapore’s education system, or (b) the current arrangements are incompatible with his welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The balance tips in favour of Option B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In my view, the risks to the Son under Option A are unreasonably higher than its benefits. While relocation offers educational and experiential upside, at this stage, it does not outweigh the significant risks to his emotional security and developmental need for day-to-day parental presence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The downsides of Option B are manageable. On a holistic assessment, the child is more likely to suffer greater harm under Option A than Option B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As the Mother has failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the Son’s overall welfare is better served by relocation than by remaining in Singapore, I dismiss the application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Final observations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Before concluding, I have some observations for the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the parents</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Both of you are trying, in your own ways, to do what you believe is best for your son. You share the same goal but differ in approach: one emphasises opportunity and early independence; the other, stability and certainty. This decision is not a judgment on your parenting philosophies. Neither does it suggest that your child is undeserving of overseas education, nor that boarding is inherently unsuitable. It reflects only my assessment that such an experience is presently not in his welfare and best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Mother and the Son</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I understand your disappointment. The Mother has invested time and resources to find a suitable school. The Son looked forward to a unique experience. This decision does not close the door to overseas education. The question can be revisited when the child is older and more mature. For now, the safer course is for him to remain in Singapore, with both parents playing prominent roles in his life – rather than appearing only as images on a screen from afar.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup><sup></sup> Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 09.10.25 at [38] to [43].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><sup></sup> Written Submissions for Applicant Mother dated 09.10.25 at [44], [45] and [60] to [64].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><sup></sup> Written Submissions for Applicant Mother dated 09.10.25 at [37] to [40].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup><sup></sup> Respondent’s Written Submissions dated 09.10.25 at [3], [26] to [31];

An interim judgment of divorce was granted on 21 October 2020, but the ancillary matters have yet to be heard to-date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       It is of considerable concern that more than five years have passed since proceedings were initiated, yet they remain resolved. Protracted litigation in family proceedings risks undermining both finality and the parties’ ability to move forward. Indeed, as noted by Tan Siong Thye SJ in <em>WXD v WXC and another appeal and another matter</em> - <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32854-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 14</a> (at [37]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The value of finality in matrimonial proceedings is vital. The parties have to close this painful chapter of their lives, and to look forward and start anew …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In <em>VTP v VTO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33727-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 52</a>, Teh Hwee Hwee J reiterated (at [28]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Therapeutic justice, as it is practised in the Family Courts, is forward-looking, and directed at enabling parties to move on with their lives following a divorce. There is much to be said for emphasising the importance of finality in litigation…</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The procedural history of the case indicates that the Husband has adopted a course of conduct that has been unduly litigious, thereby contributing to the protraction of the proceedings. In the course of an earlier appeal filed by the Husband <em>vide</em> FC/RA 1/2023 (“RA1/2023”) against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Adriene Cheong (“the AR”) given on 13 January 2023 dismissing his application in FC/SUM 3637/2022, I made the following observations:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is highly unfortunate, in my view, that the Defendant has chosen to adopt a needlessly aggressive and combative approach of taking out a summons under Rule 695, and threatening to institute committal proceedings against the Plaintiff (in his affidavit of 9 November 2022, at [14]-[15]), when this vexatious course of action was completely unnecessary for the protection of his juridical interests in this proceeding …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband’s further appeal to the Family Division of the High Court <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 4/2023 was dismissed by Lai Siu Chiu SJ who observed as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I go further to say he is motivated by malice and ill will. He is deliberately making unnecessary and unreasonable discovery requests of the Respondent and causing her to incur substantial charges in the process. This court and no court will impose deadlines over and above what a court has ordered just so the Appellant in this case    can apply for committal proceedings when the Respondent's conduct does not show any contumelious behavior.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Husband’s litigious behaviour was evident in another appeal filed by him <em>vide</em> FC/RA 1/2024 (“RA1/2024”). This was the Husband’s appeal against the decision of the AR given on 16 February 2024 refusing, <em>inter alia</em>, his application for the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking to be lifted in relation to certain documents and information, and for those documents and information to be used for the purpose of related proceedings in the General Division of the High Court (“Related HC Proceedings”) to determine the beneficial ownership of [Property A].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For the reasons explained in <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a> (“<em>WWK v WWL</em>”), I dismissed the Husband’s appeal. The Husband’s further appeal to the Family Division <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 6/2024 was also dismissed on 19 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As observed in my written grounds in <em>WWK v WWL</em> (at [56]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Given that there is no real necessity for the Husband to commence the Related HC Proceedings and taking into account the expansive nature of the orders sought by the Husband, the Wife’s apprehension that the Husband may misuse the documents and information if he is released of the <em>Riddick</em> undertaking is not without basis. This risk cannot be discounted given the conduct of the Husband as observed in FC/RA 1/2023 and HCF/RAS 4/2023. Additionally, his frequent change of solicitors deepens my concern about the propensity on his part to engage in a course of conduct that is unnecessarily acrimonious and confrontational.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     It was against the above backdrop that FC/RA 10/2025 (“RA 10”) came to be heard before me. RA 10 was the Husband’s appeal against the AR’s decision given on 25 July 2025 in FC/SUM 559/2024 (“SUM 559”) and FC/SUM 560 (“SUM 560”). By the time of this third Registrar’s Appeal filed by the Husband, he had engaged and replaced no fewer than seven law firms<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>, a circumstance which speaks to the manner in which he has conducted these proceedings. This pattern of conduct is emblematic of his broader tendency to engage in aggressive litigation, with little regard to finality and proportionality. The result has been to prolong the proceedings, resulting in the needless consumption of time and resources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     SUM 559 and SUM 660 were the Husband’s applications for discovery and interrogatories. The AR made no orders on both applications and directed for the matter to proceed for ancillary hearing without further interlocutory applications to be filed by either party.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The AR noted that a comprehensive disclosure process had already taken place over two years ago, with at least five rounds of requests made by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The current applications were filed in February 2024, following which the parties entered into negotiations culminating in an agreement to undertake a joint valuation of the Wife’s companies.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Wife had executed the Letter of Engagement (“LOE”) and paid her share of the required deposit to the agreed valuer.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The AR noted that despite multiple court directions and stipulated deadlines, the Husband failed to execute the LOE and remit his share of the deposit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s persistent non-compliance with the AR’s directions effectively frustrated the implementation of the agreed joint valuation exercise<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> and resulted in a significant and unwarranted delay of at least nine months spanning from August 2024 to April 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The AR also observed that the Husband’s litigation strategy appeared calculated to obtain further disclosure orders by repudiating the previously agreed joint arrangement without any valid justification.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> His approach has not only caused the Wife to incur unnecessary costs but has also resulted in inefficient use of judicial resources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having regard to the submissions of parties and the procedural history of the case, I agreed with the AR that the Husband’s conduct has had the effect of delaying and obstructing the progress of these proceedings. Greater judicial control is clearly warranted to ensure that the case advances without further undue delay to a hearing. Accordingly, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal. I indicated that in the event of a further appeal, I will provide full written grounds to explain my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Husband has filed a further appeal to the Family Division <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 29/2025, through his ninth set of solicitors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> This is his third appeal to the Family Division. I now set out my full grounds of decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is trite that a judge hearing a Registrar’s Appeal exercises confirmatory jurisdiction, as opposed to appellate jurisdiction: <em>VTQ v VTR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26432-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 85</a> (at [21]-[22]). As noted in <em>AOD v AOE</em> [2015] SGHC (at [21]), there are practical implications to the fact that the judge exercises confirmatory, rather than appellate jurisdiction. Among other things, the judge is not confined to interfering with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion only if it had been exercised on wrong principles of law or misapprehensions of fact but is entitled to exercise his discretion afresh, while giving due weight to the assistant registrar’s decision. In effect, he hears the appeal as if the matter came before him for the first time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Although RA 10 was an appeal against the whole of the AR’s decision, the Husband clarified at the hearing that he was not appealing the AR’s decision making no orders on the discovery applications. His appeal was confined to the AR’s direction for the matter to proceed for ancillary hearing without further interlocutory applications to be filed by either party and the costs order. The Husband accepted that it was within the power of the AR to make orders to expedite the progress of the case under the Judge-led approach but contended that the order made by the AR was draconian as it precluded the Husband from taking out any application to appoint an expert valuer to provide an expert report for the valuation of the Wife’s companies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Judge-led approach</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Rule 22(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR 2014”) (which applies to the present proceedings since they were commenced before 15 October 2024) provides as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In adopting a judge-led approach, the Court may, at any time after the commencement or at the hearing of any proceedings, of its own motion or on an application by any party to the proceedings, direct any party or parties to those proceedings to appear before it, for the Court to make such order or give such direction as it thinks fit, for the just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As the Minister for Law explained at the Second Reading of the Family Justice Bill, the Judge-led approach to adjudicating family disputes is intended to allow judges “to lead and control the pace and direction of each case, in a manner tailored to the needs and sensitives of each family”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Judge-led powers, encapsulated in Part 3 of the FJR 2014, were further strengthened by the introduction of s 11A of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“FJA”) pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee to Review and Enhance Reforms in the Family Justice System (“RERF Committee”). This provision, which came into operation on 14 October 2024, empowers the Court, <em>inter alia</em>, to control the filing of any application that will or is likely to impede the just, expeditious or economical resolution or disposal of any matter in the relevant proceedings. The enhanced powers reflect the legislative intent to reinforce active judicial case management, curb the proliferation of unmeritorious applications, and ensure that family proceedings are conducted efficiently. As observed by the RERF Committee in its report, “[t]he filing of unnecessary applications prolongs proceedings, promotes acrimony and strains judicial resources”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The exercise of discretion in judicial case management</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The exercise of the Court’s case management powers is a matter of discretion and will often require a balancing of competing interests and considerations. As noted by Choo Han Teck J in <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27460-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 9</a>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">11    … <b><em>It must also be remembered that many interlocutory orders are discretionary in nature or discretionary to a large extent. The exercise of a court’s discretion, unlike the application of an express rule or principle, should not be disturbed except in the most obvious instance in which the exercise of that discretion had led to a miscarriage of justice</em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">12    A court’s decision to allow an adjournment or an extension of time to comply with a previous order is the clearest instance of the exercise of judicial discretion. Appealing against such an order should only be made in the rarest of cases – to prevent a clear and irredeemable injustice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">13    In family matters, it behoves counsel to impress upon their clients that the resolution of their dispute ought to be made with a clear mind. This often seems terribly difficult because of the rage and animosity between people whose relationships had from love to hatred turned. Nonetheless, litigants should be advised that interlocutory orders should not be lightly appealed against …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[Emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As also noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> (at [23]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… an exercise of discretion should not be interfered with by an appellate court unless the judge had misdirected himself on a matter of principle, or he had taken into account matters which he ought not to have taken into account or had failed to take into account matters which he ought to have taken into account, or his decision is plainly wrong</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     It is not open to an appellate court to interfere with the first instance exercise of discretion simply because it would have been inclined to find a different balance: see <em>Kiri Industries Ltd v DyStar Global Holdings (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29590-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGCA(I) 3</a> (at [80]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     That said, I am mindful that in a Registrar’s Appeal, the Court is not bound by the manner in which the assistant registrar exercised his or her discretion. Nonetheless, I am of the view that the Court should be slow to interfere with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion in matters of case management. To do otherwise would risk undermining the effectiveness of the assistant registrar in managing cases and invite unnecessary appeals against proper case management decisions. Allowing proceedings to protract through such appeals defeats the very purpose of conferring broad judge-led powers on the Court to control proceedings. It also runs counter to the legislative intent underlying s 11A of the FJA, which is to strengthen judicial control and deter unmeritorious litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The AR’s decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The AR noted that that the Husband’s overall conduct throughout the proceedings of close to five years has caused substantial impediment to the expeditious resolution of the matter.

The Wife explained, <em>inter alia</em>, as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… we note that the Letter of Engagement signed by our client has catered for a situation where a party may elect to have 2 valuation dates, and in the absence of any party exercising this option, that you will “assume that this option will not be exercised”. There is hence no need to make any changes, since this was the understanding that both parties had (the possibility of which we had updated the Court about at the case conference on 11 March 2022).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     SSPL replied on the same day to say that they would not be making any changes to the LOE until parties confirm the steps to be taken.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     On 19 March 2025, the Husband’s solicitors informed the AR via correspondence as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… we understand that the cut-off date of November 2024 applies only to Phase 1 and the joint valuer is at liberty to request for additional documents beyond November 2024 for Phase 2 of his work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.    On this basis, our Client will be making payment to Mr. Wan and sign the LOE forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     However, he did not do so but instead wrote another letter to the Court dated 1 April 2025 seeking the Court’s guidance on the “Ancillary Proximate Date” (“APD”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> He stated that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Plaintiff appears to propose November 2024 as the APD, without prejudice to the valuer’s ability to request further documents. The Defendant, on the other hand, takes the reasonable view that the APD should minimally be the first quarter of 2025, to account as far as practicable for the full financial year of 2024 for all three companies (whose financial years end in December 2024, April 2025 and June 2025), so as to ensure a true and fair valuation as close as possible to the Ancillary Matters hearing date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Court replied on 4 April 2025 that it was not in a position to make a determination on this issue via correspondence and strongly encouraged parties to discuss and reach a consensus without delay.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On 22 April 2025, the Husband informed the AR that he was unable to sign off on the LOE.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> Consequently, the Husband’s discovery applications, which were held in abeyance, were restored for hearing on 5 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> At the hearing on 5 June 2025, the Husband’s solicitors applied to be discharged,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> which resulted in the hearing having to be adjourned and delayed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, the AR was justified in finding that the Husband had repudiated the agreed joint valuation arrangement without any valid justification. Having agreed to the TOR on 28 January 2025, the Husband sought unilaterally to change the terms of the TOR via the LOE by instructing SSPL to amend the LOE “to reflect that the Plaintiff should provide to you all relevant documents for the three companies up to end-February 2025”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s attempt to instruct SSPL on the conduct of the valuation undermined the ability of the joint valuer to undertake its work independently and was contrary to the spirit of a joint appointment. His insistence that the LOE be amended to include documents up to end-February 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> was unreasonable, bearing in mind that it was within the purview of the expert valuer to determine the documents they required for their work.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the LOE also provided for an option for two valuation dates.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> There was hence no justification for the Husband to interfere with the independent work of the joint valuer by dictating what documents should be obtained from the Wife and to subsequently abandon the agreed joint valuation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a result of the Husband’s conduct, SSPL could not even proceed with Phase 1 of its work, which did not involve the valuation of the three companies. As noted above, the TOR provided that the parties will consider if they jointly agree to the next stage of work of determining the actual value of the Wife’s companies to be proceeded with after SSPL has provided their 1<sup>st</sup> Stage Opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Regrettably, the Husband’s conduct is indicative of bad faith. His deliberate departure from the agreed process is wholly inconsistent with the spirt of cooperation envisaged in the joint valuation exercise and reflects a continuing pattern of obstructive and tactical behaviour. Such action not only frustrate the orderly conduct of the case but also needlessly protract the resolution of the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The AR was correct to find that the Husband’s conduct has had the effect of delaying and obstructing the progress of these proceedings. Such conduct undermines the fair administration of justice, particularly in the context of family disputes where finality of proceedings is important for parties to heal and move on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my view, this is precisely the sort of case in which the Court must wield its case management powers decisively to rein in obstructive conduct and move the case towards final resolution. As the AR was not in error, there was no reason for me to interfere with her case management decision. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I would have exercised my discretion in the same manner as she did.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The AR was mindful that the absence of either a joint valuation or competing valuations may constrain the Court’s assessment at the ancillary stage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> However, it is equally important to note that the Court determining the ancillary matters is not bound by the interlocutory order and retains the discretion to determine if a valuation report is necessary. As noted in <em>WAH v WAG</em> (at [10]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Interim and interlocutory orders do not bind the trial judge, and the trial judge may make orders at the trial varying the earlier orders. The fundamental purpose of interim and interlocutory orders is, therefore, to ensure a smoother, quicker trial, and to keep each party’s position evenly balanced until the trial. That purpose is lost if the justice system is clogged with unmeritorious appeals against interlocutory orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Unsatisfactory as it may be, it is necessary to bring an end to the meandering course these proceedings have taken as a result of the Husband’s obstructive and uncooperative conduct, and move the case towards hearing without the valuation report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Appeal dismissed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     For the above reasons, I affirmed the AR’s decision and dismissed the appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Rule 854 of the FJR 2014 provides that the Court, in exercising its discretion as to costs, “must, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account … the conduct of all parties, including conduct before and during the proceedings”. Like general civil litigation, the Court in family proceedings also has a discretion to grant costs on an indemnity basis if it considers it appropriate to do so: see r. 878(1) of the FJR 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The circumstances where an order for indemnity costs may be made were discussed in <em>Pradeepto Kumar Biswas v Sabyasachi Mukherjee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30981-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 3</a>. The Appellate Division noted (at [6]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">An order for indemnity costs is appropriate only in exceptional circumstances (<em>BIT Baltic Investment &amp; Trading Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v Wee See Boon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/30308-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 1 SLR 1648</a> at [83], citing <em>CCM Industrial Pte Ltd v Uniquetech Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 2 SLR(R) 0020.xml')\">[2009] 2 SLR(R) 20</a> at [32]). In deciding whether to order indemnity costs, the court will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, with the touchstone being that of unreasonable conduct, as opposed to conduct that attracts moral condemnation (<em>Lim Oon Kuin and others v Ocean Tankers (Pte)</em> Ltd (interim judicial managers appointed) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27431-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 1 SLR 434</a> at [36]). From our observations of the Applicant’s conduct, we find it appropriate to award costs against him on an indemnity basis. The Applicant has failed to satisfy numerous outstanding costs orders and seeks to put the Respondents to further costs of defending the EOT Application with little assurance that he will make good any costs ordered against him. He has also been found on more than one occasion to have abused the court process (ie, by the Judge in SUM 268, and by the Court of Appeal in <em>Pradeepto</em> (2022) at [95]). We repeat our observations at [45]–[46] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     As noted in <em>XHG v XHH</em> - <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32853-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 13</a> (“<em>XHG v XHH</em>”) (at [7]), costs orders are more finely balanced in family disputes which by their nature involve strong emotions. Even so, the Court may award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For instance, in <em>XHG v XHH</em>, the Court ordered the husband to pay costs on an indemnity basis for the wife having to respond to husband’s 5<sup>th </sup> affidavit of assets and means, filed just prior to the ancillary matters hearing, because it disclosed information that ought to have been disclosed from the beginning. The Court found that the husband could have provided the bank statements and explained them much earlier, and not just before the proceedings commenced. The Husband’s conduct led to the Court and the wife expending time and effort to deal with the evidence urgently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In my judgment, there were exceptional circumstances warranting an indemnity costs order in the present case. The Husband’s conduct in abandoning the agreed joint valuation and dragging out the process was wholly unwarranted and resulted in unnecessary costs being incurred and valuable time wasted. This was not an isolated incident but a continuation of a pattern of conduct displayed by the Husband throughout the proceedings. His conduct was troubling and unreasonable, to say the least.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Taking into account that the wasted costs relating to the joint valuation was included in the AR’s costs order, I awarded costs of the appeal fixed at $10,000 all in to be paid within 7 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     I should point out that the Wife had submitted that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The Defendant has decidedly opted to pursue a litigation strategy which further frustrates the expeditious resolution of the divorce proceedings, with the latest salvo being his attempt to stay these divorce proceedings by filing HC/[redacted]. This was filed despite the learned DJ Chia already finding that such related proceedings are unnecessary in his grounds of decision dated 15 May 2024 and issued in <em>WWK v WWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31499-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 25</a>,38 given that the Defendant “has a real enough choice of taking up Option 1” as envisioned in <em>UDA v UDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     For the avoidance of doubt, I did not take the Husband’s conduct in filing the High Court suit into consideration in my determination of the substantive merits of the Husband’s appeal and costs, even though this appeared to be yet another instance of his propensity to engage in tactical and protracted litigation.

Section 112(10) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”) sets out the definition of “matrimonial asset”. In brief, a matrimonial asset includes any asset which was “acquired during the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage”: see s 112(10)(b) of the Charter. An asset which was acquired before the marriage is not a matrimonial asset, unless transformed in accordance with the tests in s 112(10)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Charter. Any asset that falls within the definition of “matrimonial asset” under s 112(10) of the Charter is subject to division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As noted in <em>WAS v WAT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27228-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 7</a> (at [4]) (“<em>WAS v WAT</em>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">As a general position, all matrimonial assets and liabilities should be identified at the time of the IJ and valued at the time of the AM hearing. It is noted that the balances in bank and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the time of the IJ, as the matrimonial assets are the moneys and not the bank and CPF accounts themselves. Thus, in general, available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used. Nevertheless, where parties had specifically agreed to use a value for the asset or liability as at a different date, I adopted that value instead for this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The parties helpfully prepared, pursuant to my direction, a Joint Summary of their respective positions. As the Joint Summary was binding on the parties,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> I took into consideration the parties’ positions as stated in the Joint Summary in determining the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Joint Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties agreed that there were two joint assets, i.e. (a) the matrimonial flat and (b) SCB E$aver Account number ~ 7130 (“E$aver”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     As neither party provided a formal valuation of the matrimonial flat, I took the average of the value of $1,125,000 proposed by the Husband and the value of $1,078,000 proposed by the Wife as the estimated market value of the matrimonial flat, i.e. $1,101,500. The use of the average value is consistent with the broad-brush approach and has been adopted in several precedent cases in similar circumstances: for example, see <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I adopted the outstanding loan as of 21 October 2024, i.e. $314,595.94, proposed by the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> instead of $316,558.31 as of 31 August 2024 proposed by the Husband,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> since “in general, available values as close to the AM hearing date as possible will be used”: see [9] above. Consequently, the net value of the matrimonial flat to be included in the asset pool was $1,101,500 less $314,595.94, i.e. $786,904.06.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As regards the E$aver, I adopted the value of $21,839.11 as of August 2024 proposed by the Husband,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> instead of $21,454.11 as of 22 October 2024 proposed by the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> since the value proposed by the Husband was closer to the IJ date: see [9] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s Assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I noted from the Joint Summary that the Husband’s assets to be included in the asset pool for division were largely undisputed. The parties agreed that the insurance policies purchased by the Husband’s parents for him prior to the marriage were to be excluded from the asset pool. This was consistent with the definition of matrimonial asset under s 112(10) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The main dispute related to the HSC insurance policies purchased for the children in 2010 and 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> The Husband proposed to exclude these policies from the asset pool and he would continue to pay for the monthly premiums.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> While the Husband’s intention was commendable, I noted that there was no agreement on this issue. In the circumstances, it was appropriate to include the surrender values of these policies in the asset pool in line with established principles: see <em>WXA v WXB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31501-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 22</a> (at [33] &amp; [36]) and <em>VRJ v VRK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\"

class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (“<em>ANJ</em>”), the Court of Appeal (“CA”) set out a structured approach towards the division of matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Charter. The structured approach involves three broad steps by which the ratio of the parties’ direct contributions is first ascertained, relative to that of the other party. This is followed by ascribing a second ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions, relative to that of the other party and finally deriving the parties’ overall contributions relative to each other by taking an average of the two ratios (see <em>Twiss, Christopher James Hans v Twiss, Yvonne Prendergast</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17978-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 52</a> at [17]). In <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a> (“<em>TNL”)</em>, the CA had the occasion to revisit <em>ANJ</em>. In particular, the CA noted (at [41], [43] and [45]) and that while the <em>ANJ</em> approach works well in “Dual-Income Marriages”, the approach should not be applied to “Single-Income Marriages” as the approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Husband submitted that the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach ought to be adopted. As the Wife was gainfully employed for approximately half of the length of the marriage from 2007 to 2015, he argued that the marriage did not fall within the Single-Income Marriage envisaged in <em>TNL</em>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> The Wife, on the other hand, contended that although she had worked from 2007 to around 2015, she was the primary homemaker and as such, the <em>TNL</em> approach would be applicable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The concept of a Single-Income Marriage articulated in <em>TNL</em> was considered by the Appellate Division of the High Court (“AD”) in <em>WXW v WXX</em> [2024] SGHCF(A) 2 (“<em>WXW v WXX</em>”). Debbie Ong JAD, delivering the judgment of the court <em>ex tempore</em>, explained (at [13]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The reason why the <em>ANJ</em> approach does not apply to single-income marriages is that it “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse” (<em>TNL v TNK</em> at [44]) and thus the homemaker spouse is disadvantaged by his or her role in the marriage despite the philosophy that marriage is an equal partnership of different efforts. This rationale should guide how a single-income marriage ought to be understood.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The learned judge highlighted that just because one spouse earns far less than the other does not render the partnership a Single-Income Marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> The fact that one spouse worked intermittently over the course of the marriage does not in itself determine whether the marriage is a Single-Income or Dual Income Marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The key enquiry focuses on the roles undertaken and discharged by the spouses during the marriage: what is called for is a qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse in the marriage relative to each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> The determination of the primary roles carried out by each party is based on the facts and circumstances of each case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> A homemaker spouse in a Single-Income Marriage is the primary homemaker, not just a spouse who does some or even substantial homemaking.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As further noted by the learned judge (at [15] and [16]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">15    Family law on the division of assets has always emphasised the important roles of both spouses, where each spouse may contribute different efforts in breadwinning and homemaking. Thus, if the spouses have decided on a certain arrangement such that one spouse cares for the children and home while the other provides financially for the family, the law gives equal recognition to both types of efforts. The joint marriage partnership is built on the spouses’ joint and complementary roles where the breadwinner can focus on his or her career, assured that the children and home are well cared for by the homemaker spouse (and vice-versa) …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    Thus, whichever approach is applied, a just outcome must give sufficient recognition to the contributions of both spouses whether the spouse concentrates on the breadwinning or homemaking role …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The learned judge further emphasised that parties should not apply the <em>ANJ</em> and <em>TNL</em> approaches as if they are “technical” rules, overlooking the very rationale behind them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> Whether the task is in assessing the parties’ indirect contributions under the <em>ANJ</em> approach or determining whether a spouse is a primary homemaker in a Single-Income Marriage, the same principles are relevant – a broad-brush approach must be applied in assessing indirect and homemaking contributions, which should discourage needless acrimony during the divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having regard to the guidance provided by the AD in <em>WXW v WXX</em>, I was of the view that the <em>TNL</em> approach would be more appropriate on the facts and circumstances of the present case. Although the Wife was gainfully employed for approximately half of the length of the marriage, this did not, without more, transform the marriage into a dual-income one, contrary to the Huband’s assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The case of <em>VIG v VIH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25105-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 16</a> (“<em>VIG v VIH</em>”), where the wife had similarly worked for about half the length of the marriage, aptly illustrates the point. In <em>VIG v VIH</em>, the parties were married in 2005. The wife was a homemaker at the time of the ancillary matters hearing. Prior to that, she was working as a lawyer. She worked for about a year while in France, and also worked from 2009 to 2013 in Singapore. The court, taking guidance from the Family Division’s decision in <em>UBM v UBN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20878-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 4 SLR 921</a> at [48]–[50], held (at [63]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Hence, it is not the case that as soon as one spouse works any amount of time that the marriage cannot be treated as a “Single-Income Marriage” and that the structured approach in <em>ANJ</em> must apply. In my view, the present case falls within the scope of a “Single-Income Marriage” even though the Wife had worked for slightly under half of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the recent decision of the Family Division in <em>XPA v XPB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33891-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 57</a> (“<em>XPA v XPB</em>”), Mavis Chionh J accepted the wife’s submission that the marriage was a long Single-Income Marriage. The learned judge held (at [125]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While it is true that the Wife worked for 28 years out of the 34 years of the marriage, I do not consider that this detracts from the fact that she discharged a primarily homemaking role. I agree with the Wife’s submission that her position is analogous to that of the wives in <em>Yow Mee Lan</em> and <em>Lock Yeng Fun v Chua Hock Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0520.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 520</a>. It will be recalled that both cases were cited by the Court of Appeal in <em>TNL v TNK</em> as examples of Single-Income marriages.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While <em>XPA v XPB</em> was decided after my decision in this matter and was not considered at the time, it lends further support to my conclusion that the Wife’s employment did not necessarily render this a Dual-Income Marriage. Notably, in <em>XPA v XPB</em>, the wife had worked for substantially more than half the length of the marriage, i.e. 28 years out of 34 years of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In the final analysis, as noted by the AD in <em>WXW v WXX</em>, what is called for is a qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse in the marriage relative to each other. On the evidence before me, it was clear that the Wife’s primary role throughout the marriage remained that of a homemaker. It was not disputed that the Wife had been the primary caregiver for the children since they were born.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Indeed, the Husband acknowledged as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… I acknowledge that that the Defendant had been the primary caregiver of the children. It was with this in mind, and also subject to the children’s wishes to continue staying at the family home that I propose that care and control be granted to the Defendant while I have reasonable access to the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife bore the additional responsibility of managing [C]’s psychological and behavioural condition as he had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> This required her particular attention as [C] often exhibited

The Husband said that the Wife was constantly obsessed with finding that there was something wrong with the children and sought to unilaterally impose her beliefs on him and the therapists and counsellors.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> However, the assessment and diagnostic report from CGH dated 7 March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> showed that [C] was referred by the Polyclinic<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> because of concerns about his anger management, excessive online gaming, self-harm, aggressive behaviours directed at family members and passive suicidal ideation. The referral letter from the Polyclinic noted, among other things, that [C] displayed “violence (says he will kill himself, will hit mother – punch mother, younger brother – force grab” and “[h]ear voice calling his name” and had “suicidal verbalisation this week, monday/tuesday, punch his own head”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The report noted, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Social Responsiveness Survey completed by his form teacher suggested deficiencies in social behaviour that were clinically significant and might lead to mild to moderate interference with everyday interactions. The clinical picture that emerged was described as Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by DSM-5.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The report noted that [C] may struggle with social cues and meaning behind verbal and non-verbal messages and instructions, and he may also have difficulty reading facial expressions. The report recommended for [C] to continue to receive therapy sessions in the Neurobehavioral Clinic (Autism Services) and that it would be helpful for teachers to play a patient, understanding and supportive role in school. The report further recommended that the parents could benefit from further psychoeducation to help them better understand the disorder and support [C]’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The report by CGH, which bore out the Wife’s concerns, demonstrated the Wife’s attentiveness and commitment as the primary caregiver, which stood in stark contrast to the Husband’s dismissive attitude and troubling lack of insight into [C]’s developmental needs. The Husband’s suggestion that the Wife “wanted a medical opinion that she could use as an excuse and pretext that she needed to be home to care for [C] and hence, not look for a job”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> could not be taken seriously. In my view, it reflected a cavalier disregard for the circumstances that prompted the Wife to seek medical attention for [C] and the tremendous burden she had been shouldering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In an attempt to show that the Wife became a stay-at-home mother by circumstance and not by choice, the Husband sought to portray the Wife as a job-hopper, pointing out critically that she did not last for more than six months in several of her jobs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> The Husband also said that the Wife was forced to resign in many of her jobs as her superiors had found her performance to be sub-par.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Yet, I noted that the Wife had remained in her employment for a continuous period of almost five years before her resignation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> By any account, this could not be considered a short period of employment. While it was not disputed that the Wife was asked to resign,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> this must be considered in the context of the realities she faced – having to balance full-time employment with the care of both children, one of whom has special needs - a circumstance that further underscored her role as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Although the Husband disputed the extent of the contributions made by the Wife and the sacrifices she had made for the family,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> the objective facts showed that the Wife had been the primary caregiver of the children since birth and had been a full-time homemaker since 2015. The Wife’s employment for half of the marriage did not alter the fact that this was, in substance, a Single-Income Marriage. A qualitative assessment of the roles played by each spouse relative to each other showed that she discharged the primarily homemaker role.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     As the Husband had premised his submissions on the basis of the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach, I invited him to provide a supplementary submissions on the basis of the <em>TNL</em> approach. In his supplementary submissions, the Husband submitted as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">We submit that if however this Honourable Court is not minded to apply ANJ v ANK structured approach to the facts of the case and is indeed minded to apply the TNL approach, we submit that the outcome ought not to be deviated substantially between the two approaches and regardless of the approach adopted after giving regard to all the circumstances of the case as stipulated paragraph 112(2) of the Women’s Charter, we submit that the decision must accurately reflects the respective parties’ contributions or lack thereof during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In my respectful view, the Husband’s contention that that the outcome “ought not to be deviated substantially between the approaches” was not an accurate articulation of the legal position. The fact that the court must give sufficient recognition to the contributions of both spouses whether the spouse concentrates on the breadwinning or homemaking role did not mean that the outcome would be substantially the same whichever approach was taken. It was precisely because the <em>ANJ</em> structured approach “tends to unduly favour the working spouse over the non-working spouse” that the CA in <em>TNL</em> found it necessary to provide for a different approach for Single-Income Marriages, in line with the philosophy of marriage being an equal partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In determining the proportion of division in Single-Income Marriages, the trend in past cases is relevant. As noted in <em>BOR v BOS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22441-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 78</a> (at [113]), the trend in “moderately lengthy marriages” of around 15 to 18 years was towards awarding the homemaker wife about 35% to 40% of the matrimonial assets. In the present case, the length of the marriage was about 16 years and 9 months as of the date of the IJ. Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including the responsibility of caring for two children, one of whom has special needs, I found it just and equitable to award the Wife the higher end of the range, i.e. 40% of the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The final division ratio as such was 60 (Husband) : 40 (Wife).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The total value of the asset pool was $1,738,817.95.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Wife’s 40% share of the asset pool was $695,527.18 and the Husband’s 60% share of the asset pool was $1,043,290.77.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although the Husband wanted to be given the first option to take over the matrimonial flat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> and had also indicated that he would prefer to have the matrimonial flat sold in the open market than transferring it to the Wife,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> I was of the view that the Wife should be given the first right of retaining the matrimonial flat given the needs of the children: see s 112(2)(c) of the Charter; <em>VWM v VWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29258-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC(A) 4</a> (at [18]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The total value of the assets in the Wife’s sole name and the matrimonial flat was $910,848.51 ($123,944.45 add $786,904.06). Hence, if the Wife chooses to exercise her right to retain the matrimonial flat, the amount to be paid to the Husband would be $215,321.33 ($910,848.51 less $695,527,18) and $X (being the payment made by the Husband towards the outstanding housing loan after 21 October 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In the circumstances, I made the following orders on the division of matrimonial assets:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife shall have the first right to take over the Husband’s rights, title and interest in the matrimonial flat.

Parties shall bear the costs of the transfer equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In the event that the Wife chooses not to exercise her right in accordance with clause (a) above, the matrimonial flat shall be sold in the open market at or above market value within 18 months from the date of the Final Judgment.

Thereafter there should be no spousal maintenance for the Wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> On the other hand, the Wife sought $1,250 per month for spousal maintenance for an indefinite period.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The power to order maintenance in favour of a former spouse is supplementary to the power to order the division of matrimonial assets. The court takes into account each party’s share of the matrimonial assets when assessing the appropriate quantum of maintenance for a former spouse: see <em>WRX v WRY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31799-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC(A) 22</a> (“<em>WRX v WRY</em>”) (at [57]). It is also a trite principle of law that an “order of maintenance is not intended to create life-long dependency by the former wife on the former husband”. A former wife “ought to try to regain self-sufficiency”: see <em>XKT v XKU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33192-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 27</a> (at [83]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     While I found the sum of $1,000 per month proposed by the Husband to be reasonable, I did not think that this was an appropriate case to fix a duration. The Wife had been out of the workforce for more than 10 years and faced significant issues with her mental and physical health.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> In addition, she would have to take care of the children as the parent with sole care and control. This must, no doubt, be challenging, given that [C] is a child with special needs.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> In the event that the matrimonial flat is sold, she would face the additional challenges of helping the children adjust to a new environment. Given these circumstances and the uncertainty that lies ahead, it was simply unrealistic to fix a timeline at this point in time. In any event, the law allows for a variation in the event of a material change in circumstances even if a timeline was not specified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In the circumstances, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife spousal maintenance of $1,000 per month with effect from 15 September 2025 and thereafter on or before the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month into a bank account to be specified by her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Child Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Wife’s position was that the sum of $2,500 ($1,250 per child) should be paid to her monthly, and that medical and dental bills should be paid on a reimbursement basis.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Husband’s position was that he would contribute $850 a month for each child, i.e. totalling $1,700 a month. He sought to pay the monthly sums to the children directly. In addition, the Husband would also pay for the listed expenses at paragraph 45(c) of his Written Submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> directly. He also proposed that upon the Wife procuring gainful employment, she was to bear 50% of the children’s fees, school-related expenses, medical and dental expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As noted by the AD in <em>WRX v WRY</em> (at [62]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">At the outset, we emphasise that parties should not take an overly mathematical or calculative approach to the children’s maintenance. An order for maintenance should not be based on the parties curating a list of specific expenses, as if each item on the list represents an item to be specifically provided for. While parties should submit a list of the current expenses of the children in order to provide the court (and the other party) with the children’s likely monthly expenses, a maintenance order does not cast those listed items in stone as if only those specific expenses are allowed to be incurred for the children. Instead, the assessment of reasonable monthly expenses upon which the order for maintenance is made is based on broad budgeting rather than the itemisation of specific expenses (<em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> (“<em>WBU</em>”) at [10]–[11]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     As regards the parties’ obligations to maintain the children, the following observations of the court in <em>XOY v XOZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33680-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 49</a> (at [138]) were instructive:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I next consider the appropriate contributions of the parties to C2’s expenses. It is statutorily provided in s 68 of the Women’s Charter that each parent has a legal duty to maintain his or her children. In <em>AUA</em> at [41], the Court of Appeal described that the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities undergirds the provision – “both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities”. By way of comparison, I refer to <em>TIT v TIU and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> (“<em>TIT</em>”), which was referred to by the Court of Appeal in <em>AUA</em>. In <em>TIT</em>, the court did not order the Wife to contribute to the maintenance of the children because she had no income at all; at [63]. In contrast, in the present case, the Wife is drawing an income. I find the Husband’s approach, based on the ratio of their respective incomes, to be fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Applying the broad budgeting approach, I found the maintenance sought by the Wife for each child to be reasonable. Indeed, I noted that the difference between the parties’ positions was not that far apart. As the Wife was the parent with care and control of the children and hence bore the responsibility of managing the daily expenses of the children, the maintenance ought to be paid directly to her. Of course, if the Husband wishes to give any additional pocket money to the children out of love for them, he is at liberty to so. Indeed, this will be most commendable. With regard to the Husband’s request to fix a quantum for the Wife’s contribution to the children’s maintenance upon procuring gainful employment, I was of the view that it would be premature for the court to do so. Among other things, the Wife’s income, which is a relevant factor in apportioning the parties’ contributions, would only be known when she has obtained gainful employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the circumstances, I ordered the Husband to pay a monthly sum of $2,500 ($1,250 per child) with effect from 15 September 2025 and thereafter on or before the 15<sup>th</sup> of each month into a bank account to be specified by the Wife. In addition, the Husband is to pay for the medical and dental bills of the children on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As noted in <em>WRX v WRY</em> (at [75]), the usual costs order in ancillary matters proceedings on financial relief is for parties to bear their own costs. As there was nothing exceptional in the present case to depart from the usual position, I ordered each party to bear its own costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p

They have two children from the marriage, two boys aged 8 years old and 6 years old.

The marriage lasted approximately 11 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Pursuant to mediation, the parties agreed on interim arrangements as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Parties shall have joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Plaintiff shall have interim care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Defendant shall have interim access to the children as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       On the odd weekends of the month, on Sundays from 5pm to 7pm at The Seletar Mall.

The Plaintiff shall drop the children off at the Defendant's parents' residence at the start of the Defendant's interim access and pick the children up at the Defendant's parents' residence at the end of the Defendant's interim access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Plaintiff is at liberty to be present during the Defendant's interim access in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Parties may mutually agree to change any of the abovementioned interim access arrangements in writing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The abovementioned arrangements are without prejudice to either party's position on care and control, access, maintenance and the division of matrimonial assets in FC/D 5152/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The consent order above was recorded in the Order of Court (Divorce) dated 6 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Pursuant to mediation, parties agreed on the issue of maintenance as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Pending the determination of the ancillary matters in FC/D 5152/2023, with effect from 17 May 2024 and thereafter by the 16<sup>th</sup> of each subsequent calendar month, the Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff S$2,450 per month as interim maintenance for the children of the marriage, to be paid into the Plaintiff’s designated bank account. The sum of S$2,450 per month includes the following expenses incurred by the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       S$1,200 per month, being the Defendant's contribution to the children's living expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       S$900 per month, being the Defendant's contribution to the children's tuition / enrichment classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       S$350 per month, being the Defendant's contribution to the domestic helper's expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The abovementioned interim maintenance arrangement is without prejudice to either party’s position on care and control, access, maintenance for the children including backdated maintenance and the division of matrimonial assets in FC/D 5152/2023​.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     There shall be no spousal maintenance for the Plaintiff and the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Other than spousal maintenance, the following issues were contested:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Care and control and access of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Division of matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I heard parties on 9 July 2025 and 22 August and reserved judgment. These are now the reasons for the orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody Evaluation Report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Having reviewed the evidence before me, I have determined that the previously directed Custody Evaluation Report (“CER”) is no longer necessary. In the interest of expediting resolution for all parties, I dispense with the order for the CER and proceed to set out my orders on the children-related issues below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody, Care and Control and Access of the Children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Custody</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife sought sole custody of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, providing a comprehensive account of how she has been the children’s primary caregiver throughout the course of the marriage and cited various violent/unpleasant incidents involving the Defendant in the presence of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband sought joint custody of the children, indicating notwithstanding that cooperation between parties is difficult, there are no exceptional circumstances to justify the award of sole custody in favour of one party or another<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I first set out the overarching consideration for orders relating to custody and/or care and control of child(ren) found at section 125(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>2</em>)     <em>In deciding in whose custody, or in whose care and control, a child should be placed, the paramount consideration is to be the welfare of the child and subject to this, the court is to have regard —</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)     <em>to the wishes of the parents of the child; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)     <em>to the wishes of the child, where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     While the Court cannot be exhaustive on types of issues that would fall under the category of custody, the case of <b><em>CX v CY (minor: custody and access) </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a></b> (“<b><em>CX v CY</em></b>”) has helpfully established that custody typically encompasses decision-making on religion, education and major healthcare issues<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. It is pertinent to distinguish and remind parties that these matters differ from day-to-day decisions, which remain with the parent who has care and control of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Education</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The children attended several childcare centres in their early years. It is not disputed that the Wife managed majority of the administrative matters relating to the children’s enrolment and communications with the childcare centres. Such an arrangement, where one parent handles day-to-day childcare communications after both parents have jointly made decisions about their children's education, is a common practice in many families. However, the fact that one parent manages the administrative matters does not diminish the other parent's right to participate in decision-making. From the Wife’s evidence, she kept the Husband informed of details relating to enrolment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> and included him in email correspondence regarding the children’s enrolment matters<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     When it was time for the elder son’s primary 1 enrolment, it is well noted that the Wife invested considerable effort in researching potential primary schools and had shared her findings with the Husband via WhatsApp<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. Although the Husband's responses to her were brief, he explained in his AOM that he had given thought to selecting the most suitable school for their elder son<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. While the Wife was displeased with the Husband’s unilateral registration of school options, I accept the Husband’s position that parties still had the opportunity to modify their choice and select a different school if they had reached a different decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife's evidence and actions demonstrate that since their children's early years, both parties have either discussed or kept each other informed about decisions regarding the children's school enrolments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>. This demonstrates her understanding that the choice of childcare centre/school enrolments were matters for joint discussion. I do not see why the parties cannot continue to do so, with more effort on both sides to have cordial and constructive discussions for the welfare of their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Medical</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband claims that he was primarily responsible for the children’s medical needs, such as bringing them to medical appointments most of the time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>, and exhibiting several medical tax invoices spanning the years of 2017 to 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>. While the Wife did not deny the Husband’s claim, she provided evidence of WhatsApp conversations with the Husband, demonstrating her active involvement in monitoring the children's health, including discussions with the Husband about their illnesses and the care provided by herself and her mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Based on the evidence, I am satisfied that both parents diligently fulfilled their parental responsibilities when the children were unwell, including monitoring their conditions at home and seeking medical attention when necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Are there exceptional circumstances which warrant sole custody to be granted?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16      <b><em>CX v CY</em></b> indicated that the court prefers joint or no custody orders<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> unless exceptional circumstances warrant sole custody to be granted. Exceptional circumstances are where one parent physically, sexually or emotionally abuses the child, or where the relationship of the parties is such that co-operation is impossible even after the avenues of mediation and counselling have been explored, and the lack of co-operation is harmful to the child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The question to be determined then is whether there are such exceptional circumstances which warrant sole custody to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife cited various violent/unpleasant incidents involving the Husband in the presence of the children, and recent incidents where the older son seem to be displaying concerning behaviour<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It is undisputed that the Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) filed by the Wife against the Husband was granted on 27 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. However, I set out two observations relating to the PPO:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife had filed PPO applications on behalf of the children. However, the applications were withdrawn on 3 April 2023; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO granted on 27 July 2023 was set aside by virtue of HCF/DCA 73/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As the applications on behalf of the children were withdrawn, the Court does not need to consider whether physical violence was committed against them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Regarding the Wife’s PPO, although it is the High Court’s judgment that there is insufficient evidence to find the Husband to have committed family violence against the Wife, this does not negate the occurrence of altercations between the parties. The Husband was reminded to refrain from any repeat of behaviour that would provoke further altercations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Wife also submitted that the older son has recently been displaying concerning behaviour, and that the children displayed discomfort and resistance to meet the Husband for access<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>. For example, the Wife submitted that the children were uncomfortable with the Husband’s constant recording during the access period. I am of the view that these incidents appear to be a direct consequence of the divorce proceedings, where the Husband may have been recording for evidentiary purposes. Moving forward, I urge the Husband to be more mindful of his actions keeping in mind how his children may perceive these actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The High Court, in giving brief decisions for the appeal of the PPO, highlighted that the children seemed to have been involved in parties’ disputes, having been questioned by the parties on what they witnessed or what they said they witnessed during the parties’ altercations, effectively encouraged to pick sides. I agree with the High Court, observing that considerable evidence submitted by both parties are in the form of video and/or voice recordings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I take this opportunity to remind parties of the observations set out in <b><em>CLB v CLC </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27071-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHCF 3</a></b> (“<b><em>CLB v CLC</em></b>”) at [41]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>41</em>      <em>As I had observed at the hearing, such photographs and videos are not always of assistance to the court – they may capture a moment (or several moments) in time during that parent’s interaction with the child, but they do not capture the events and interactions leading up to that moment (or after). Such evidence may be relevant, yet it may have weight that is disproportionately prejudicial to its relevance. Further, allowing the parties to photograph and document their interactions with the children may also be detrimental to the children’s relationship with their parents, especially if the children are aware that they are being filmed or photographed by that parent to be “used” as evidence in court proceedings. Being filmed for evidence is intrusive, which can potentially cause a sense of discomfort and “unnaturalness”. It may also constitute a persistent reminder to the children of their parents’ conflict, which will have an adverse impact on their wellbeing. I also had concerns over the possible impact on the children in the long term. When the children are grown and look back at how their past behaviour, words and reactions captured as evidence were used by one parent against the other, will feelings of guilt, self-blame and betrayal arise and affect them in some way, as well as</em> their relationships <em>with each parent then? I ordered that the parties were not to photograph, document or record videos and/or audio recordings of the children for the purposes of use as evidence or reference in court.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Parties have lived separately since sometime in December 2023. Whilst there may be some friction when parties meet for Husband’s access to the children, I am of the view that this can be attributed to the stresses of undergoing divorce proceedings. This cannot be said to be the best time to assess whether parties are truly unable to cooperate, nor does it suggest that parties will not be able to cooperate after the conclusion of the proceedings, with the best interests of the children as their paramount consideration. I do not find that parties’ relationship is such that cooperation is impossible, considering the examples cited above on education and medical needs of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     There are no other compelling reasons to suggest that the Husband should not be part of the decision-making process relating to the children. The order of joint custody indicates to parties that whilst their marriage may have broken down, they are still very much responsible for the upbringing of the children. Parties should put aside their differences and objectively make joint decisions in the best interests of their children. Accordingly, I order that parties be granted joint custody of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and Control</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The interim consent order on care and control of the children and access arrangements has been in place for approximately 1 year and 5 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Wife sought sole care and control of the children with reasonable access to the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Husband sought sole care and control of the children with liberal access to the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>. The Husband also sets out his proposed position on access arrangements should he not be awarded sole care and control of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband also relied on an affidavit by the parties’ previous helper<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, to support his assertion that he was the party handling all aspects relating to the family’s daily life and household matters. The Wife has indicated her responses to the helper’s affidavit at her 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Matters Affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. She contended that the failure of the Husband to provide corroborating evidence in his affidavit(s) undermines the credibility of the helper’s affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I am inclined to accept the Wife’s position on the helper’s affidavit. While I accept that the Husband would have contributed to the family during the marriage, such claims could be substantiated by corroborating evidence, such as specific examples and details of his day-to-day involvement, in his own affidavit(s) rather than relying on third-party testimony. I also find that the helper’s affidavit carries little to no weight towards assisting the Court in coming to a decision for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The helper's continued employment with the Husband's family creates a potential conflict of interest, as her current financial dependency may influence her inclination to support the Husband's position in these divorce proceedings. I consider the weight of her evidence in light of this relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I accept that the Wife approached the helper and asked if she would be willing to write a note on her observations, but the helper indicated that she was not inclined to do so for either party<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. This shift in position, particularly given the comprehensive nature of the affidavit, raises concerns about the context in which the affidavit was prepared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The considerations that the Court take into account whether to grant sole care and control have been discussed in detail in <b><em>XDZ v XEA </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a></b> (“<b><em>XDZ v XEA</em></b>”) at [14] to [16].

The Wife has also provided evidence that the Husband frequently returned home late at night<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Who is the primary caregiver?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In view of paragraphs 33 and 34 above, I find that the Wife has been the primary caregiver of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Which parent has a stronger bond with the children?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Husband tendered evidence depicting positive interactions and quality time spent with the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>, while the Wife submitted the children’s behaviour became concerning once interim access arrangements started <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I accept that the children have happy memories with their father. However, I am of the view that the Wife has a stronger bond with the children for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whilst not a binding factor, I did consider the maternal bond, considering the children’s young ages; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The fact that the Wife has been caring for the children since they have left the matrimonial home in December 2023. This continuous period of approximately 1.5 years of daily caregiving would naturally foster a stronger bond between the Wife and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     This is only one of the many factors I considered, and it is only a myriad of a whole slew of factors. Despite their young age, the children would have inevitably sensed the marital tensions that led to the family's separation. As separation rarely occurs without underlying issues, I urge both parties to focus on the future and take active steps to strengthen their bonds with the children. Parties should be looking ahead and focusing on rebuilding and strengthening their respective relationships with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>The children’s wishes</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Given the tender ages of the children (8 years old and 6 years old), I agree with the Husband’s position that the children are not of age to express an independent opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Future caregiving arrangements</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Which parent can provide better care for the children?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Pursuant to my directions given on 24 June 2025, both parties had included in their respective submissions future care plans for the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. The Wife has also provided the current care plan of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband submitted that he has a flexible work schedule which would allow him to provide better care arrangements for the children, such as changes to the operating hours, tailoring his own work hours or even work remotely<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. The Husband is prepared to forgo his own lifestyle preferences and expenses and prioritise the children’s needs and welfare. The Husband also submitted that he would be purchasing an apartment in Ang Mo Kio which he hopes will be within 1 or 2km from XXX Primary School (likely where both children will attend)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     It is commendable for the Husband to reflect on his work and lifestyle and commit to making changes to prioritise the children’s needs and welfare. Even if the Husband is not granted sole care and control, I hope that the Husband will maintain his commitment to prioritising the children's needs and welfare and continue to provide them with the best possible care during his time with them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I am of the view that the Wife's submission demonstrates a more structured and well-considered approach to the children's future care arrangements. The proposed care arrangements for the younger son mirror the established routine of the older son, as the younger child is expected to attend Mayflower Primary School alongside his brother. This arrangement demonstrates a practical and cohesive approach to both children's education and daily routines.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Which parent can provide a secure and stable home environment?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For the reasons listed at paragraphs 40 to 43 above, I am of the view that the Wife can provide a secure and stable home environment for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Which parent is more willing to promote a healthy relationship between the children and the other parent?</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While the Wife has been facilitating the Husband’s weekly access to the children since the consent order was entered into, the Husband alleged breach of interim orders by the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> and the Wife’s attempts at alienating the children from the Defendant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     On the Husband’s allegations, the Wife responses were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     19 April 2024 incident where the school did not allow the Husband to pick or speak with the elder son even though he arrived 30 minutes before the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The general office staff was not aware that the teacher had already contacted the Wife and proceeded to contact the Husband.

I also directed the correspondence to be exhibited in affidavit as it is evidential in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I pause to remind parties that the Court will not condone any illegal activities and urge parties to cease any such behaviour forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Is there any evidence that the other parent had intentionally or knowingly acted against the child’s best interests</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Based on the evidence tendered, I do not find that either party had intentionally or knowingly acted against the children’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">General considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Continuity of living arrangements</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The children have been living with the Wife since they left the matrimonial home in December 2023. The Wife has set out the current care plans and future care plans of the children in her submissions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     If the sole care and control was to be granted to the Husband, the children’s current routine of approximately 1 year 8 months will be disrupted. While the Husband has submitted that he will be purchasing an apartment in Ang Mo Kio which he hopes will be within 1 or 2km from XXX Primary School (likely where both children will attend)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>, he has not presented evidence demonstrating that he has taken substantive steps towards securing stable accommodation for the children. The parties will also need time to dispose of the matrimonial property, before he is able to purchase and move into a new apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I find that it is in the children’s best interests for the current living arrangements to continue. Whilst maintaining the status quo should not be the be-all and end-all, it is still a relevant factor for consideration. As I find nothing untoward about the Wife’s conduct during this period, there is no cogent reason why the status quo should be disrupted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Siblings should not be separated</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Neither party has submitted for the siblings to be separated.

While his dedication is commendable, I am not minded granting the requested access for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Morning routines typically involve caregivers preparing children for school within tight time constraints. Scheduling access during these hours may create unnecessary tension or discord if delays occur when the Husband is ready to pick the children up; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The children may have differing school dismissal times, making a fixed 5pm pickup impractical. This would necessitate daily coordination between parties regarding collection timing, which may create unnecessary complications. Moreover, as the children grow older, they may prefer greater autonomy in managing their after-school schedules and travel arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Unsupervised access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Husband sought for unsupervised access to the children. The Wife has not raised any objections to unsupervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     While I acknowledge the Wife's concerns regarding the children's behavioural changes since the commencement of weekly supervised interim access with the Husband<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span>, there is no evidence that the behavioural issues were caused by the Husband's conduct. The children's concerning behaviour may well be a manifestation of their distress from being caught in the ongoing marital conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     It is likely that the children have grown distant from their father and show signs of resisting access, having lived separately for approximately 1 year and 8 months. However, the Wife must assist the children to navigate their emotions and help them to understand that while the marriage between parties have broken down, both parents remain integral to their lives, and maintaining a relationship with their father is essential for their well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     With the unsupervised access arrangements, the potential for altercations between parties, which were present during the weekly supervised access, would be reduced. I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Husband to have unsupervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overnight and overseas access</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The Husband sought regular overnight access and holiday overseas to the children. On the other hand, the Wife does not support overnight access and proposed regular, non-overnight and non-overseas access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I find that immediate overnight and overseas access will not in the children’s best interests at this stage for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children require an adjustment period from the weekly supervised interim access to the increased unsupervised access arrangements. Adding the layer of overnight and overseas access immediately may be overwhelming for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The priority should be addressing the children's receptiveness to access arrangements with the Husband before contemplating any expansion to overnight stays or overseas travel; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_68-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given that the children have not resided with the Husband since December 2023, they have adapted to daily routines without his presence. A period of adjustment would be necessary to help them acclimate to overnight stays and overseas travel with the Husband, once the children are comfortable with the unsupervised access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     I put in place graduated overnight access. Notwithstanding the above, parties are free to mutually agree further on overnight and/or overseas access, should the opportunity arise. If there is no agreement, parties are at liberty to apply.

However, I note that the Husband appears to accept an equal attribution of the vehicle's value between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Accordingly, I adopt the value of $49,000.00 for the motor vehicle and attribute $24,500.00 to each party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XXX Treasure Pte Ltd (“XXX Treasure”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The following details are not disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_89-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The company was incorporated on 31 July 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_98\" id=\"Ftn_98_1\"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_89-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Prior to the incorporation of the company as a private limited company, the Husband ran XXX Treasure as a sole proprietor<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_99\" id=\"Ftn_99_1\"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_89-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The value of the company is agreed at $524,670.00<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_100\" id=\"Ftn_100_1\"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     For the purposes of determining the pool of matrimonial assets, the disputed issue is whether the Husband has full ownership of XXX Treasure, or whether his shareholding is limited to 60%.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     The Husband asserted that he holds only 60% of the shares, with the remaining 40% equally distributed between two investors.

While she was aware that the Husband took loans from various people (which included herself and the two alleged shareholders of XXX Treasure), the Wife was not aware that anyone else held ownership in XXX Treasure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Investment Agreement was handwritten and dated 20 March 2021. The two parties are the Husband’s sister and close friend whom the Husband took loans from.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband could not provide conclusive evidence of the purported $100,000.00 extended by each of the other two parties as funds towards XXX Treasure; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_92-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Neither of the two alleged shareholders opted to take out High Court Proceedings for the determination of third-party interests in XXX Treasure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     At the hearing on 9 July 2025, I asked the Husband’s counsel to clarify when the shareholding of XXX Treasure came into being, as there was no valuation of the sole proprietorship that would show payments by the two parties equivalent to 20% each as of 2021. I directed the Husband’s counsel to produce XXX Treasure’s 2021 accounts (when it was run as a sole proprietorship), whether as a balance sheet or profit and lost statement. The Husband’s counsel tendered a letter to court dated 25 July 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_103\" id=\"Ftn_103_1\"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>, confirming that there was no balance sheet for 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The Husband (or his counsel), then took the opportunity at paragraphs 4 to 10 to explain the context behind the Investment Agreement and detailed the breakdown of transactions that purportedly constitute the contribution amount specified in the Investment Agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     I decline to accept the explanations at paragraphs 4 to 8 and 10 and the supporting documents at annexes A and B of the letter. The Wife had asked for supporting evidence of the Investment Agreement as early as her request for discovery dated 18 September 2024. While I note that the Husband provided his explanations and supporting documents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_104\" id=\"Ftn_104_1\"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span>, his explanations at paragraphs 4 to 8 and 10 and further supporting evidence at annexes A and B of the letter could have been included in his affidavit. The Husband had ample opportunities to include the explanations and supporting documents but did not do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     I accept paragraph 9 of the letter insofar as it tabulates the tranches of investment and includes the references to the pages where the supporting evidence is found.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     Having reviewed the evidence before me, I find that the Husband has not proven, on a balance of probabilities, his claim of 60% ownership in XXX Treasure. The Business Profile of XXX Treasure contradicts the shareholding structure claimed in the Investment Agreement. While the Husband contended that it is common practice for small businesses to have a single person fronting the business<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_105\" id=\"Ftn_105_1\"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span>, I find the evidence in support of the Husband’s claim lacking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     It is also noteworthy that none of the two parties had come forward to file any affidavit claiming the accuracy of the nature of the transactions, nor filed any application in the High Court to determine third-party interests in XXX Treasure. The Wife relies on <b><em>UDA v UDB and another </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21720-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 20</a><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_106\" id=\"Ftn_106_1\"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span></b> to address the Court on its powers to make orders relating to XXX Treasure:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>58</em>      <b><em>The other situation is where the property is in the name of one of the spouses and the third party is a “shadowy” figure in the wings whom that spouse claims has an interest in the property but no order is sought by or against the third party directly. In such a case, because no order is sought by or against the third party, it is permissible for the court to make an order exercising its powers under s 112 because the only parties directly affected by the order will be the parting spouses. This, again, is an Option 1 course. </em></b> <em>The choice of Option 1 would have the same risks for the spouses as alluded to in [57] above. Thus, for instance, the spouse in whose name the property stands, having been ordered to share the value of the property with the other spouse, may later find he or she has to account to the third party for such value or to transfer the property outright to the third party. This is because the determination of the ownership of the disputed property in the s 112 proceedings will not bind the third party who may challenge it in separate proceedings. But that is the risk the spouse takes by not seeking an order that will bind the third party. Once such an order is sought, in our view, this would be the same situation as discussed in [56(b)] above and a separate set of proceedings would have to be issued.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

However, no explanation on the nature of the transfer was given by the Wife.

Furthermore, the Husband sought to clawback monies as far back as 2020, when the parties’ relationship had not yet deteriorated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    For the reasons set out above, I decline to include these sums to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\"> <u>Withdrawal of $20,692.00 from parties’ joint account</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    I note from the Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit where she confirmed that she withdrew a sum of $20,000.00 from the parties’ joint account.

I find that the sum was expended towards the children’s expenses. Accordingly, I decline to add this sum back to the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    The Wife’s position was that there was standing instruction for recurring monthly payments to the helper, which was cancelled after 16 May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_152\" id=\"Ftn_152_1\"><sup>[note: 152]</sup></a></span>.

The marriage was dissolved in February 2024. On 9 May 2024, a Consent Order was recorded on the ancillary matters comprising orders for the division of the matrimonial flat and other assets (“AM Order”) including the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Each party shall retain their respective assets in their own names.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 6 March 2025, the Plaintiff applied for leave for an Order of Committal against the Defendant for the Defendant’s continual non-compliance of the above order. Leave was granted on 12 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The assets in dispute were 2 dogs named X and Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       In the application, the Plaintiff sought the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>a.     The Defendant is in contempt of Court as he has continually breached the Order of Court by failing, neglecting, and / or refusing to return the 2 dogs to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>b.     The Defendant is to return the dogs to the Plaintiff forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>c.     The Defendant is sentenced to imprisonment and / or fine for contempt of Court should he fail, neglect, and / or refuse to return the Dogs to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>d.     Costs of this application to be provided by the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Having heard the application, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application with costs of $3,500. The Plaintiff appealed against my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>a.     Plaintiff affidavit in support filed on 22 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>b.     Plaintiff reply affidavit filed on 12 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Defendant filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>a.     Defendant 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit filed on 6 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>b.     Defendant’s witness “Miss B” filed on 6 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>c.     Defendant reply affidavit filed on 26 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Oral application to strike out </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Under Rule 647, Family Justice Rules 2014, the court may strike out any matter in an affidavit that is scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive. The court’s power to strike out is discretionary in nature.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At the start of the hearing on 5 June 2025, the Plaintiff’s counsel applied to strike out parts of the Defendant’s 1<sup>st</sup> and Miss B’s affidavit on the ground that they contained either hearsay or expert evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Having heard the arguments, the following paragraphs or sentences within the paragraph of the Defendant’s 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit were struck out:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>a.     Paragraph 12. The last sentence “They acknowledge my messages and did not request me to return the dogs” and the documents exhibited in TAB 1 of the affidavit were struck out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The following sentences were not:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Sometime in or around end 2024, we found a buyer for the matrimonial and sold our matrimonial home, pursuant to the Order of Court. The completion date of sale was in March 2025. As such, on 20 January 2025, I moved out of the matrimonial home together with X and Y. I wanted to inform the Plaintiff of this but she blocked me on WhatsApp so I could not reach her. I had no choice but to inform the Plaintiff's sister-in-law and her brother instead that I had moved out of the matrimonial home and I have taken X and Y with me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>b.     Paragraphs 13. The sentences in the paragraph other than those below were struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">X is a male dog born on 24 February 2015. He was purchased and paid by the Plaintiff's former husband, Mr. A, in or around 2016 <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>c.     Paragraph 14. The whole of paragraph 14 was struck out.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>d.     Paragraph 15. The whole paragraph other than the following sentence was struck out <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">After my divorce with the Plaintiff concluded, our matrimonial home was ordered to be sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Plaintiff also applied for paragraphs 16 to 18 and 22 to 26 to be struck out. The paragraphs read:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16.    Screenshots of my WhatsApp conversation with Mr. A on 10 November 2024 evidencing the above are enclosed at TAB 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17.    Y is a male dog born on 5 April 2019. I personally adopted Y in 2019 after I saw my friend, Miss B 's, adoption advertisement on Facebook seeking to rehome Y. Miss B is a dog seller in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">18.    I reached out to Miss A and requested to view Y in person. The Plaintiff did not join the viewing. After viewing, I decided to adopt Y and brought him home. Ever since his adoption, I have been caring for him. The Plaintiff had no role in the adoption. Screenshots of my conversations with Miss B confirming that I was the one who took the step and made the decision to adopt Y are enclosed at TAB 3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Plaintiff also objected to paragraph 22 on the ground that it contained expert opinion on dogs. Paragraphs 22 to 26 were as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22.    Dogs are highly social animals that require regular attention, interaction, and companionship from their humans to thrive. Without sufficient attention, dogs can experience stress, anxiety, and even depression. As someone who claims to be an owner, the Plaintiff should be well aware of these needs. However, her history of disengagement clearly reflects otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ADD OR AMEND THE VETERINARY RECORD FOR THE DOGS' OWNERSHIP</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.    On 27 January 2025, I visited M Clinic (&quot;the Clinic&quot;) to obtain the medical records from the Clinic so that I can transfer the Dogs' medical records to another clinic which was nearer to my new home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24.    However, the Clinic told me that the Plaintiff instructed them not to disclose any information to me. The Plaintiff's act of hindering me access to their medical needs are clearly acting in bad faith and failed to consider the needs of X and Y. It dawned on me that, like her ex-husband, she is merely using them as a pawn to annoy me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">CONCLUSION</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">25.    Mr. A is the actual owner of X. He has expressly given his consent for me to have and care for X. As for Y, I personally adopted him and have been solely responsible for his upbringing, care, and well-being since the adoption. My role as the person who has provided for both dogs clearly reflect me as the beneficial owners of the Dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">26.    The act of registering X and Y in her name does not confer the Plaintiff's ownership especially where I have been their primary caregiver. Ownership is not determined solely by registration, but by the actions and responsibilities undertaken in caring for the animals. I aver that I am the beneficial owner of the Dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I was of the view that the matters stated in paragraphs 16 to 18 and 23 to 24 were relevant. Paragraph 16 made reference to WhatsApp messages between Mr A and the Defendant including the following by Mr A to the Defendant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Previously she was supposed to handover X to me or pay me back $5k agreed with her lawyer. X is under my name and I purchased him using my card. She neglected him for many days and went away and didn’t come back.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for the matters set out in paragraph 22, I did not think these were confined only to experts. Paragraphs 25 and 26 were the Defendant’s concluding remarks which should be allowed to stand. I thus did not order for the above-mentioned paragraphs to be struck out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Plaintiff also objected to paragraphs 5 and 8 of Miss B’s affidavit which read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">5.    I recall that Z then sent me a Facebook message informing me that the Defendant is interested in adopting W (Y’s former name) . The messages are enclosed herewith at TAB A. At the material time, I did not share a close personal friendship with the Defendant. Shortly after receiving Z ’s message, I recall that the Defendant contacted me directly via my mobile phone to express his interest in adopting W and requested to view W in person. Upon learning that the Defendant was already keeping another beagle as a pet, I was reassured that W would be placed in a home where he would receive appropriate care. Consequently, I agreed to permit the Defendant to adopt W and duly informed Z of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">8.    Moreover, W is a beagle, a breed known for its high energy levels and natural hunting instincts. Thus, beagles are active and intelligent dogs that require regular exercise, mental stimulation, and structured routines to ensure their physical and emotional wellbeing. It is clear to me that the Defendant is well aware of their needs and has shown a commitment to providing W with appropriate care, including daily walks, playtime, and engagement, all of which are essential to the breed’s health and happiness. I know all this because following the handover, I remained in occasional contact with the Defendant for the purpose of checking on W’s well-being, and I subsequently came to understand that the Defendant had renamed the dog as Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Paragraph 5 narrated how Y (formerly called “W”) came into the Defendant’s possession while paragraph 8 contained Miss B’s account of Y which the Plaintiff objected on the grounds that it contained expert opinion<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. I did not accede to the application to strike out these paragraphs. Paragraph 5 was relevant while in paragraph 8, Miss B had made the statements not as an expert but based on her personal knowledge of the subject-matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the above hearing, the Plaintiff’s counsel informed that the Plaintiff had additional documents of about 147 pages to submit to the court as she thought that she could do so at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     As Defendant had not seen the additional documents, I directed the Plaintiff to file a further affidavit with the additional documents and that the Defendant filed an affidavit in reply to that further affidavit. I also gave the Plaintiff permission to raise any objection if the Defendant raised any new issue in his reply affidavit. I directed written submissions to be prepared after which I would deliver my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Plaintiff’s further affidavit was filed on 12 June with the additional documents to show how she took care of the 2 dogs. She produced invoices from veterinary clinics and pet shops. She also submitted photographs of her and the dogs to show that she had cared for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Defendant’s affidavit in reply of 26 June in response to the Plaintiff’s affidavit also contained the Defendant’s evidence on the expenses he incurred on the dogs and photographs of the Defendant and the dogs to show that he had also cared for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Plaintiff also sought to expunge paragraphs 10 to 15 of the Defendant’s affidavit in reply on the basis that these were not included in his earlier affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. Having considered the objections, I was not inclined to do so as the paragraphs concerned were in rebuttal to the Plaintiff’s further affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Plaintiff’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The grounds for committal as stated in the Statement for Order of Committal was that the Defendant had breached the Order by “failing, refusing, and/or neglecting to return” the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff claimed that she should retain ownership and possession of the dogs as the dogs were in her sole name as evidenced by the licenses issued to her by the Animal and Veterinary Service (“AVS”) pursuant to the Animal and Birds Act 1965 read with the Animal and Birds (Licensing and Control of Cats and Dogs) Rules 2024:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>a.     In respect of X, the Plaintiff was issued a Dog Licence in July 2016, before the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>b.     In respect of Y, the Plaintiff was issued a Dog Licence in January 2025, after the AM Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In breach of the Order, the Defendant had, on 20 January 2025, removed the dogs from her residence. On 27 January 2025, her solicitor served on the Defendant a letter with the Order of Court endorsed with a Penal Notice notifying the Defendant of the breach and seeking the return of the dogs. The Defendant did not return the dogs to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Defendant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Defendant contended that the dogs were not matrimonial assets and should not be treated as divisible matrimonial assets. Dogs were not capable of valuation for division and should not be treated as commodities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Plaintiff had never mentioned, discussed or negotiated an agreement with him on the dogs throughout the proceedings despite being represented in the divorce proceedings. The Plaintiff had always felt that the dogs belonged to him and as he did not think that was in dispute, the parties had not contemplated the issue of the dogs at that juncture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     As the completion date for the sale of the matrimonial home was in March 2025, on 20 January 2025, he moved out of the home together with the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Defendant claimed that X was owned by Mr A, the Plaintiff’s former husband, and after the annulment of her previous marriage, the Plaintiff was supposed to handover X to the Defendant but the Plaintiff went ahead to obtain the dog license for X in her sole name without the former husband’s consent. The Defendant claimed that Mr A agreed that the Defendant could keep X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As regards Y, the Defendant informed that he had personally adopted Y (i.e., to keep Y as his pet) in April 2019 after seeing an advertisement on Facebook put up by Miss B, a dog seller. He did not think that it was necessary to register Y with AVS. Without his consent and knowledge, the Plaintiff registered Y in her name with AVS in January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Miss B’s confirmed that she did place Y for adoption via Facebook. She received a message from a close friend that the Defendant was interested in adopting Y. The Defendant contacted her personally and eventually Miss B agreed to the Defendant adopting Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Analysis </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether the dogs were matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To address the Defendant’s contention, the Plaintiff relied on <em>Tan Huey Kuan (alias Chen Huijuan) v Tan Kok Chye and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0086.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 86</a> wherein the court faced a similar issue. In that case the dispute before the High Court was over the ownership and possession of a female black terrier dog. The court in the above case, decided on the issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In view of the above, I came to the view that the dogs were matrimonial assets. As with other assets, parties could agree on how they were to be dealt with including an order for them to be given to which party, declaring which party to own such or ordering a sale and division of the proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Was the Plaintiff the owner of the 2 dogs and thus capable of enforcing the Court Order if the Defendant had been in contempt?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The AM Order had no mention of the 2 dogs. To prove ownership, both the Plaintiff and the Defendant produced evidence to show that they had cared for, paid for or contributed towards the expenses to maintain the 2 dogs. However, in my view, the real issue was not so much as to who has cared or expended more for the dogs but who was the actual legal owner of the 2 dogs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     From the facts, there was no evidence that parties had applied their minds as to whom the dogs should go to or how they were to be dealt with when dealing with the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     There was no evidence that the 2 dogs were featured in the prayers for ancillary reliefs in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. There was also no Affidavit of Assets and Means prepared where parties addressed their minds as to the fate of the 2 dogs when considering the ancillary issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Plaintiff had to prove that she was the owner of the 2 dogs. This could be done by showing, for example, that she had bought the 2 dogs or they were gifted to her by someone which would make her the owner of the dogs. The Plaintiff was unable to provide any such evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Plaintiff claimed that she owned the dogs by virtue of the licenses issued to her under the Animals and Birds (Licensing and Control of Cats and Dogs) Rules 2024 (“Rules”). The Dog Licence for X and Y named the Plaintiff as the licensee.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I was of the view that the licensing of the dogs under the above rules did not confer ownership on the licensee. Under rule 4 of the above Rules, a person who intended to keep a dog in any premises must submit an application for a licence. There was no requirement that the person applying for such a license must be the owner of the dog.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Unlike in <em>Tan Huey Kuan’s</em> case where the parties went to the extent of adducing evidence at the main hearing as to who had the right to possession and ownership of the dog, there was no such proceedings in this case. In my view, a committal proceeding was not the correct procedure for such an inquiry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Defendant provided an explanation as to how X came into his possession. At paragraph 16 of his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit, he exhibited screenshots of his WhatsApp conversation with Mr. A on 10 November 2024. The WhatsApp message stated that Mr A was the owner of X and that the Plaintiff was supposed to handover X back to Mr A or pay Mr A the sum of $5,000 as was agreed previously with the Plaintiff’s lawyer. Mr A had paid for X and was thus the true owner of X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As for Y, it was the Defendant who was the party responsible for bringing Y into their former household. This was confirmed by his witness, Miss B, who stated that she gave Y to the Defendant and not to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Court’s powers to punish conduct in relation to an order of court is set out in section 4 (1) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (“AJPA”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">4(1)  Any person who —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    intentionally disobeys or breaches any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    intentionally breaches any undertaking given to a court, commits a contempt of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Further, section 21 of the AJPA provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“A person is not guilty of contempt of court under section 4(1), (2) or (3) if the person satisfies the court that the failure or refusal to comply with a judgment, order, decree, direction, writ or other process of court or any undertaking given to a court was wholly or substantially attributable to an honest and reasonable failure by that person, at the relevant time, to understand an obligation imposed on the person bound by the judgment, order, decree, direction, writ, process or undertaking and that that person ought fairly to be excused.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The standard of proof for civil contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. The person alleged must also be shown to have committed the breach intentionally. The court in <em>Mok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18910-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1</a> stated at [85] and [86]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">85.    First, it is well-established that the applicable standard of proof to both criminal and civil contempt is that of the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt: Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0518.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518</a> (“Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd”) at [31]–[32], citing In re Bramblevale Ltd [1970] Ch 128 at 137.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">86.    Secondly, as regards the issue of the requisite mens rea to establish contempt for disobedience of court orders, it is accepted that it is only necessary to prove that the relevant conduct of the party alleged to be in breach of the court order was intentional and that it knew of all the facts which made such conduct a breach of the order: Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd at [51]. This necessarily includes knowledge of the existence of the order and its material terms. It is, however, not necessary to establish that the party had appreciated that it was breaching the order. Therefore, the motive or intention of the party who had acted in breach of the order is strictly irrelevant to the issue of liability though it may have a material bearing in determining the appropriate penalty to be imposed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     On the evidence, I was of the view that Plaintiff had not discharged the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I was not satisfied that the Defendant had intentionally committed the breach. In respect of X, the Defendant must have genuinely believed that the Plaintiff was not the rightful owner of X as Mr A, X’s rightful owner has represented to the Defendant that the Defendant could keep X. The Plaintiff had not given any evidence to prove otherwise. In respect of Y, it was given to the Defendant by Miss B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The court order concerned must not be ambiguous or unclear. In Mok Kah Hong’s case at [78], the Court of Appeal, stated:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">78.    In our view, the decisions in Re Oddy ([74] supra) and Iberian Trust ([74] supra) demonstrate the importance and impact of the manner in which an order of court is framed and extracted in determining whether the order can be enforced by way of committal proceedings. As Luxmoore J had observed in Iberian Trust, an order must state in unambiguous terms what had to be done on the part of the defendant in order for committal proceedings to lie against the defendant. This is, in our view, a rule of fairness. A defendant cannot be punished for failing to comply with an order of court if it is unclear what is expected of the defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I agreed with the Defendant’s submission that the clause concerned was ambiguous. As explained in paragraph 33 to 34 above, there was no evidence that parties had applied their minds as to whom the dogs should go to or how they were to be dealt with. There was no evidence that the 2 dogs were featured in the prayers for ancillary reliefs in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. There was also no Affidavit of Assets of Means prepared where parties addressed their minds as to the fate of the 2 dogs when considering the ancillary issues. Such ambiguous clause should be interpreted in favour of the Defendant. His conduct would also be excusable under section 21 of the AJPA mentioned above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     For completeness, I would add that the Plaintiff had also submitted that she was also the beneficial owner of the 2 dogs. No legal basis was put forth by the Plaintiff to show that there was such a concept for the asset involved. I thus did not think that the Plaintiff could succeed on this basis as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     For the above reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiff’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the extent to the work done to resist the application I awarded costs of $3,500 to the Defendant.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Notes of Proceedings (NOP) at page 14 line 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>NOP page 19 line 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>NOP page 20 line 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>NOP page 21 line 22.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>NOP page 28 at line 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Made in the Plaintiff written submissions.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2025-11-03","court":"Family Court","case-number":"OADV 78/2025 and MSS 2631/2024","title":"XTW v XTX and another matter","citation":"[2025] SGFC 119","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34034-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Nur Amalina Binte Saparin (Adel Law LLC) for the Father, applicant in FC/OADV 78/2025 and respondent in MSS 2631/2024","Ms Fang Yashi (Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Mother, respondent in FC/OADV 78/2025 and applicant in MSS 2631/2024."],"timestamp":"2025-11-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Phang Hsiao Chung","html":"<root><head><title>XTW v XTX and another matter</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XTW <em>v</em> XTX and another matter </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34034-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 119</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">OADV 78/2025 and MSS 2631/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">03 November 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Phang Hsiao Chung </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Nur Amalina Binte Saparin (Adel Law LLC) for the Father, applicant in FC/OADV 78/2025 and respondent in MSS 2631/2024; Ms Fang Yashi (Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Mother, respondent in FC/OADV 78/2025 and applicant in MSS 2631/2024. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XTW — XTX </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">3 November 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Phang Hsiao Chung:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties are the father (the “Father”) and the mother (the “Mother”) of a boy (the “Child”) born in 2009.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       On 7 March 2013, the Mother commenced divorce proceedings against the Father in D 1145/2013.

On the weekends when the Mother had to work, she made other arrangements to make sure she still spent time with the Child and stayed involved in his life by “coordinating a replacement time” with the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father often made it hard for the Mother to spend time with the Child. There were “many times” when the Mother’s parenting time was limited because the Father “gave last minute reasons” or “didn’t communicate properly”. There were several weekends when the Mother was told that the Child could not stay over, and could only meet for dinner, usually because of schoolwork or exams. There were also multiple occasions when the Mother was not informed by the Father, and found out from the Child, that the Child had travelled overseas with the Father. The Father deliberately limited the Child’s time with the Mother by using different excuses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother also gave in to the Child’s requests to change the Mother’s care and control period. The requests could be made during festive seasons or for other excuses (e.g. to attend Buddhism class or to visit the Father’s mother).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The order in the Interim Judgment requiring the Father to pay the Mother $500 per month as child maintenance was made by consent. When the Father stopped making those payments, the Mother did not enforce the order at that time as the Mother was concerned that doing so might damage the relationship between the Child and the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The child maintenance of $500 per month was agreed on the basis that the Mother would exercise care and control of the Child from Friday 12 pm to Sunday 5 pm, and would cover the Child’s expenses during this period. However, the Mother has been deprived of meaningful care and control time with the Child. Nevertheless, the Mother continued to give the Child cash whenever she had the opportunity to meet him. There was therefore no material change in circumstances to justify varying the order for the maintenance of the Child, as the care and control arrangements for the Child remained unchanged.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     During the hearing on 31 July 2025, I asked the parties’ counsel to address the Court on the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     when did the Child stop staying with the Mother at any time from Friday to Sunday, as envisaged by the Interim Judgment (“First Issue”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     after the Child stopped staying with the Mother in the manner envisaged by the Interim Judgment, what form of provision of “accommodation, clothing, food and education” did the Mother provide the Child, and what was the period of such provision (“Second Issue”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     when did the Father stop paying the Mother maintenance for the Child (“Third Issue”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father’s counsel submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the First Issue, there was no specific date or point in time when the Child stopped staying with the Mother. Instead, it was gradual decrease over time. In the Interim Judgment, it was 2 nights. Slowly it became 1 night, from Saturday afternoon to Sunday morning or afternoon. Eventually, it became just weekend meals with the Mother. The Father could not pinpoint a certain point when overnight access stopped. However, since August 2020, the Mother would arrange to have dinner with the Child only on Saturdays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the Second Issue, the Father’s position was that the Mother’s financial provisions for the Child were limited to paying for the Child’s meals, giving additional pocket money, and buying items when the Mother and the Child went shopping together. The Father was unable to quantify the extent of the Mother’s financial provisions for the Child. However, the Father’s counsel agreed that the Mother spends about $250 per month on the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the Third Issue, the Father stopped making payments after January 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother’s counsel submitted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On the First Issue, the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother from May 2023 onwards. This was supported by a WhatsApp message sent by the Child to the Mother on 3 April 2023, which was exhibited at page 10 of MA1. Before that, the Mother would care for the Child during the designated time from Friday to Sunday, as stated in paragraph 4 of MA1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the Second Issue, the Mother covered the Child’s expenses during the period she had care and control of the Child, as stated in paragraph 13 of MA1. The Mother gave the Child pocket money amounting to $120 per month, and spent $30 per week for other expenses for the Child, as set out in M1. The Father admitted, in paragraph 8 of his counsel’s written submissions, that the Mother had incurred “ad hoc expenses involving paying for [the Child’s] meals and buying for [the Child] items / toys when they meet, and giving [the Child] cash as additional pocket money”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On the Third Issue, the Father stopped paying child maintenance in February 2014.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">FC/OADV 78/2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) requires each parent of a child to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of the child, whether the child is in the parent’s custody or the custody of any other person, either by providing the child with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable, having regard to the parent’s means and station in life, or by paying the cost thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Paragraph 3(a), (e) and (f) of the Interim Judgment contained consent orders that envisaged that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     both parties would have joint custody, and shared care and control, of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Father would have care and control of the Child from Sunday 8 pm to Friday 12 noon, with reasonable access to the Mother;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Mother would have care and control of the Child from Friday 12 noon to Sunday 8 pm, with reasonable access to the Father;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Father would pay the Mother $500 per month as maintenance for the Child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     in addition, the Father would bear all of the Child’s school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and educational related expenses up to tertiary level.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Interim Judgment recognised the differences between the means of the Father (who was earning a monthly gross income of $8,540 when I heard the applications) and the Mother (who was earning a monthly gross income of $2,100 when I heard the applications). Therefore, paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment required the Father to contribute $500 each month to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child during the periods in that month when the Mother had care and control of the Child, while paragraph 3(f) of the Interim Judgment required the Father to bear all of the Child’s school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and educational related expenses up to tertiary level.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Under paragraph 3(a)(ii) of the Interim Judgment, the Mother was to have care and control of the Child from Friday 12 noon to Sunday 8 pm. As this order contemplated that the Child would stay overnight with the Mother, the Mother’s duty under section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 extended to providing the Child with suitable accommodation while the Mother had care and control of the Child. The cost of renting premises that can accommodate both the Mother and the Child does not vary according to the number of days in a month that the Child stays overnight with the Mother. Therefore, so long as the Child continued to stay overnight with the Mother at any time in a month:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Mother’s duty to maintain the Child extended to providing the Child with suitable accommodation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother would have to incur the costs of providing such accommodation, regardless of the number of days when the Child stayed overnight with the Mother; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     there was no reason to reduce the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child merely on account of the Child staying overnight with the Mother on fewer days per month than contemplated under paragraph 3(a)(ii) of the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     There is some evidence that the Child was still staying overnight with the Mother until 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The following exchange of WhatsApp messages between the Child and the Mother on 3 April 2023 (reproduced from page 10 of MA1) suggests that as at 3 April 2023, the Father had agreed that Child would stay overnight with the Mother from Friday, 7 April 2023 (which was Good Friday in 2023) to Saturday, 8 April 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <u>Child</u>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Mummy, daddy say friday go your house then saturday come back [19:27]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Are you free on firday?

These exchanges also supported the Mother’s claim that the Father dictated when the Child could stay overnight with the Mother, and prevented the Mother from exercising care and control of the Child to the full extent of the Mother’s entitlement under the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother admitted through her counsel that from May 2023 onwards, the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother. Thereafter, the Mother’s only expenses in relation to maintaining the Child comprised pocket money of $120 per month and miscellaneous expenses of $30 per week (or approximately $130 per month, calculated from $30 per week times 52 weeks per year divided by 12 months). By the Mother’s own admission, the amount that she now spends per month on the Child amounts to no more than $250. While there is evidence suggesting that the Father had prevented the Mother from exercising care and control of the Child to the full extent of the Mother’s entitlement under the Interim Judgment, this did not change the fact that over time, there was an actual reduction in the amount incurred by the Mother in maintaining the Child. This constituted a change in the circumstances sufficient to justify reducing the amount of the maintenance contributed monthly by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Mother is also liable to contribute to the maintenance of the Child. On the evidence, the Father’s monthly gross income is $8,540, while the Mother’s monthly gross income is approximately $2,100. As the Father’s monthly gross income is slightly more than 4 times the Mother’s monthly gross income, in line with the parties’ relative earning capacities, I decided that the Father should bear 80% of the amount of $250 that the Mother pays each month for the maintenance of the Child. I therefore reduced the amount of the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 per month to $200 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I then considered whether the variation in the amount of maintenance should be backdated. As the Mother admitted that the Child stopped staying overnight with her from May 2023 onwards, it would not be fair to require the Father to contribute $500 per month to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child after May 2023. I therefore backdated the variation in the amount of maintenance to 1 June 2023, and ordered that the amount payable by the Father to the Mother as maintenance for the Child under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment be reduced to $200 per month with effect from 1 June 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">MSS 2631/2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     It is not disputed that the Father stopped contributing to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from February 2014. There is inconsistency in the Father’s evidence as to whether the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother from August 2017<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> or August 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>. Regardless of the position adopted by the Father, there is evidence, including from the Father’s affidavits,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> that the Child continued to stay overnight with the Mother in 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the period from February 2014 to the time the Child stopped staying overnight with the Mother, the Child continued to receive at least accommodation and food from the Mother. Therefore, there was no reason to reduce the Father’s liability for the agreed maintenance during that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Although the Father (by his own admission) has been in arrears since February 2014, the Mother only claimed maintenance arrears of $18,000 as at 28 November 2024. Simple arithmetic will show that the Mother did not claim the full amount of maintenance that the Father had denied the Mother, based on the Father’s admission of when he stopped paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Both parties assumed that section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 applied to this case. Section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Maintenance arrears are not recoverable in any proceedings (whether commenced before, on or after the date of commencement of section 24 of the Family Justice Reform Act 2023) from the defaulter if the amount accrued due more than 3 years before the commencement of the proceedings, unless —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    other proceedings to recover the amount from the defaulter had previously been commenced within 3 years (or any longer period that the court in those proceedings may have allowed) after the amount accrued due; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The predecessor of section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 is section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, which has a different ambit, and states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Section 91R of the Women’s Charter 1961 is contained in the present Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961. When section 91R, and the rest of the present Part 9, of the Women’s Charter 1961 came into operation on 16 January 2025, they only applied to certain classes of maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961 was replaced by section 24 of the Family Justice Reform Act 2023 (Act 18 of 2023) (the “FJRA”). Section 121 of the Women’s Charter 1961 was deleted by section 25 of the FJRA. Section 45(13) to (15) of the FJRA sets out the saving and transitional provisions for sections 24 and 25 of the FJRA in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(13)  Subject to regulations made under subsection (15), despite sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>), sections 69, 71, 71A, 71B, 71C, 74, 75, 76, 77, 121, 121G(2) and Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before the date of commencement of sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>), continue to apply as if sections 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25 and 35(<em>b</em>) had not been enacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(14)  Subsection (13) ceases to apply to any class of maintenance orders, and in the circumstances, as may from time to time be prescribed under subsection (15).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(15)  The Minister charged with the responsibility for law may, by regulations prescribe —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    the classes of maintenance orders and circumstances for the purposes of subsection (14); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    such provisions of a saving or transitional nature consequent on the regulations made under paragraph (<em>a</em>) as the Minister may consider necessary or expedient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     By virtue of section 45(13) of the FJRA, Part 9 and section 121 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, continue to apply to the enforcement of maintenance orders as if sections 24 and 25 of the FJRA had not been enacted. However, the Minister for Law may make regulations under section 45(15) of the FJRA to prescribe a class of maintenance orders to which, and the circumstances in which, section 45(13) of the FJRA would cease to apply. Where the Minister for Law has made such regulations, then by virtue of section 45(14) of the FJRA, section 45(13) of the FJRA would cease to apply to the prescribed class of maintenance orders, and consequently, the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961 will apply to that class of maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The regulations made by the Minister for Law under section 45(15) of the FJRA were the Family Justice Reform Act 2023 (Cessation of Application of Section 45(13)) Regulations 2024 (G.N. No. S 994/2024) (the “Cessation Regulations”). When the Cessation Regulations came into operation on 16 January 2025, regulation 3 of those Regulations provided for the cessation of the application of section 45(13) of the FJRA in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Cessation of application of section 45(13) of Act</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.    For the purposes of section 45(14) of the Act, section 45(13) of the Act ceases to apply on or after 16 January 2025 to any relevant maintenance order in respect of which —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    there is at least one concluded maintenance enforcement application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    there is no pending maintenance enforcement application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     MSS 2631/2024 was commenced on 28 November 2024. When section 24 of the FJRA (and consequently, the present Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961) came into operation on 16 January 2025, the version of the Cessation Regulations that applied to MSS 2631/2024 was the version as in force on 16 January 2025. Although the maintenance order that the Mother sought to enforce in MSS 2631/2024 (namely, paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment) was a “relevant maintenance order” (as defined in regulation 2(1) of the Cessation Regulations), there was no previous maintenance enforcement application made in respect of that maintenance order. Therefore, section 45(13) of the FJRA did not cease to apply to paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment. Consequently, by virtue of section 45(13) of the FJRA:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961, which came into operation on 16 January 2025, did not apply to MSS 2631/2024; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Part 9 of the Women’s Charter 1961, as in force immediately before 16 January 2025, continued to apply to MSS 2631/2024, as if the present Part 9 (including section 91R) of the Women’s Charter 1961 had not been enacted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The version of the Cessation Regulations as in force on 16 January 2025 continued to apply until immediately before 1 October 2025. As such, section 91R of the Women’s Charter 1961 did not apply to MSS 2631/2024 when the matter was heard on 31 July 2025. As the Mother only claimed arrears of $18.000, but the total amount of maintenance that the Father had failed to pay under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment was significantly more than that, I assessed the amount of maintenance arrears as at 28 November 2024 to be $18,000 (calculated from $500 times 12 months times 3 years). To be clear, even after taking into account the reduction in the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023, the total amount that the Father failed to contribute towards the Mother’s maintenance of the Child in the 4-year period from December 2020 to November 2024 would have exceeded $18,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The parties did not submit on whether section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (as in force immediately before 16 January 2025) might apply to MSS 2631/2024 in place of section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Even if section 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (or section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025) had applied to MSS 2631/2024, I was of the view that there were special circumstances, under section 91R(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (or section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961 as in force immediately before 16 January 2025), for the Court to allow the Mother to recover $18,000 of maintenance arrears from the Father. The amount of $18,000 would have represented 3 years of arrears, if the Court had not reduced the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023. Given the Father’s egregious failure to comply with paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment since February 2014, despite the Father’s ability to contribute to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child, it would not be fair to reduce the amount of arrears that the Mother would otherwise have been entitled to recover under paragraph 3(e) of the Interim Judgment, had the Court not reduced the Father’s liability for maintenance. Further, even after taking into account the reduction in the Father’s contribution to the Mother’s maintenance of the Child from $500 to $200 with effect from 1 June 2023:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the amount of $18,000 was less than the amount that the Father would have been liable to pay in the 4-year period from December 2020 to November 2024; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the $18,000 of maintenance arrears that the Court allowed the Mother to recover from the Father would have represented amounts that accrued due no more than 4 years before the commencement of MSS 2631/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     After I assessed the amount of maintenance arrears as at 28 November 2024 to be $18,000, the Father’s counsel proposed that the Father pay $500 per month towards the maintenance arrears, in addition to the $200 per month that will be payable as maintenance moving forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I therefore ordered the Father to pay the maintenance arrears of $18,000 (as at 28 November 2024) in 36 monthly instalments of $500 per month, with the first payment to be paid by 15 August 2025, and with subsequent payments to be made by the 15th day of each subsequent month.

He submitted that this was a breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father claimed that his understanding was that proceedings before the Family Court are confidential. In making this argument, he cited section 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“<b>FJA</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In response, counsel for the Mother made the following submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father had not shown what was the confidential information the Mother had circulated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Mother had only sent her written submissions to her current husband. In this regard, the Father had not shown the basis for which confidentiality attaches to the Mother’s own written submissions. The Father did not cite any case law for why an injunction should be issued in a case where a person has forwarded documents to her current spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother referred to <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24986-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 77</a> at [15] (“<b><em>VLI</em></b>”) that set out the principles governing the grant of interim injunctions and claimed that the Father failed to establish a basis for his application. She claimed he had not shown that there is any serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience did not favour the grant of the manifestly excessive injunctive order sought by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father’s claim, as he had framed it, is premised on him establishing an action for breach of confidence, in order for him to obtain the injunctive relief sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     A preliminary issue that would therefore arise is whether an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The issue of whether an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court was considered by in the case of <em>UQZ v URA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22699-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 2</a> (“<b><em>UQZ</em></b>”) at [23] to [24]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“23    The law of confidence is based on the court’s equitable jurisdiction to restrain breaches of confidence. The court may restrain the use of confidential material through the grant of an injunction or an order to expunge offending portions of pleadings or affidavits: see <em>Wee Shuo Woon v HT SRL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20603-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 94</a> (“<em>Wee Shuo Woon</em>”). However, the <b>jurisdiction of a court is derived from statute: see </b><b><em>UDA v UDB </em></b><b><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21720-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGCA 20</a> (at [48]). The Family Court’s jurisdiction is contained in s 26 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (No. 27 of 2014) (“FJA”). As an action for breach of confidence does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Family Court, the Wife would not be able to avail herself of remedies premised on the said cause of action.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">24    If the Wife wishes to pursue an action for breach of confidence, it is open to her to commence separate civil proceedings. A case on point is <em>ANB v ANC and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17820-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 43</a> (“<em>ANB v ANC</em>”) where the husband had, in the midst of divorce proceedings, commenced separate civil proceedings claiming, inter alia, breach of confidence when he discovered the surreptitious copying of the information from his personal notebook when the wife attempted to adduce some of that information as evidence in the acrimonious divorce proceedings they were embroiled in. <b>The High Court had set aside, inter alia, an interim injunction previously granted at the ex parte stage in favour of the husband restraining the wife and the law firm which represented the wife</b>. The CA allowed the husband’s appeal and granted an interlocutory injunction in terms.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(Emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     From the above case, the following principles are clear:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An action for breach of confidence does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Family Court and a party would not be able to avail himself/herself of remedies premised on the said cause of action; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If a party wishes to pursue an action for breach of confidence, it is open to that party to commence separate civil proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Jurisdiction of the Family Court </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     After considering the Father’s submissions, I was not satisfied that the Father had established that an action for breach of confidence fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court. As such, the Father did not establish that he could avail himself of the remedies premised on the said cause of action, based on the facts of the present application in SUM 3101.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father failed to point to express wording in any written law vesting jurisdiction in the Family Court to hear actions for breach of confidence or the remedies premised on the said cause of action (including restraining the use of confidential information through the grant of an injunction). I elaborate on this below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Family Court’s jurisdiction to hear applications is found in section 26 of the FJA. In this regard, section 26(2)(a) of the FJA, <em>inter alia</em>, provides that a Family Court has all the jurisdiction of the General Division of the High Court (“<b>GDHC</b>”) mentioned in section 22(1)(a) and (b).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Section 22 of the FJA clarifies that the part of the civil jurisdiction of the GDHC which is exercised through the Family Division consists of:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a\"></a>a.       The jurisdiction conferred on the GDHC by sections 17(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) and 17A of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 (“<b>SCJA</b>”) whereby:</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a-p4_i\"></a>i.       Section 17(1)(a), (d), (e) and (f) of the SCJA, <em>inter alia</em>, specifies that the civil jurisdiction of the GDHC includes jurisdiction under any law relating to divorce or matrimonial causes, to appoint and control guardians of infants, to grant probate of wills and testaments, letters of administration;</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_a-p4_ii\"></a>ii.       Section 17A relates to concurrent jurisdiction with the Syariah Court in certain matters; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b-p3_b\"></a>b.       Such other jurisdiction relating to family proceedings as is vested or conferred on the GDHC by any written law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From the above, the relevant sub-sections of section 17 of the SCJA do <em>not</em> specify that actions for breach of confidence fall within the jurisdiction of the GDHC (and consequently, the Family Court). On this basis, the Father failed to establish that an action for breach of confidence fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I had also considered that the Father had also implicitly referred to section 10 of the FJA (which was not cited in his prayers or written submissions) as his basis for his argument that matters before the Family Court are confidential. In brief, section 10 of the FJA provides that all matters and proceedings in a Family Justice Court must be heard in private. Having reviewed the said section, the Father did not demonstrate how section 10 of the FJA expressly provides that an action for breach of confidence falls within the jurisdiction of the Family Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     From the above, I was unable to find that the Father had shown that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to hear an action for breach of confidence and the power to grant any remedies in relation thereto.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Specifically, the Father failed to demonstrate that he would be able to avail himself of the remedies premised on an action for breach of confidence, insofar as his prayers had been framed to relate specifically to the said cause of action, such as restraining the Mother from disseminating confidential documents or further documents disclosed to her in circumstances imparting a duty of confidence (see paragraph 8(a) above).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In addition, as the Father did not show that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to hear an action for breach of confidence , he did not show why orders should be made for the Mother to disclose documents “<em>evidencing any breaches of confidence</em>” or provide interrogatory answers in relation thereto (see paragraphs 8(b) and 8(c) above). For completeness, the Father also did not demonstrate why making further orders for discovery or interrogatories were necessary or relevant, bearing in mind that the Father already had filed various applications for discovery and interrogatories, to which orders had already been made (including the Discovery Order), whereby the Mother had filed a compliance affidavit of more than 1000 pages on 14 October 2024 (“<b>Discovery Affidavit</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Furthermore, I did not find any basis to grant the Father's prayers seeking orders for the Mother to deliver any electronic devices on which “<em>the confidential information… may have been stored</em>” or for an independent third party to take the Mother’s electronic devices into possession to “<em>carry out the terms of the injunction sought</em>” and to review the Mother’s electronic devices to identify any evidence of the dissemination of any confidential (see paragraph 8(d)), insofar as this was premised on an action of breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     For completeness, I had considered that the Father had, in any event, not shown that there was a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting or refusing the interlocutory relief that he sought based on the facts and circumstances of this particular case. For ease of reference, the principles on interim injunctions, as summarised in the case of <em>VLI</em> at [15] to [16] have been reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“15    As stated by the High Court in the recent case of <em>Challenger Technologies Ltd v Courts (Singapore) Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17823-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 218</a> (“<b><em>Challenger Technologies</em></b>”) at [13], the principles governing whether an interim injunction should be granted were laid down by the House of Lords in the case of <em>American Cyanamid Company v Ethicon Limited</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/66816-E-M.xml')\">[1975] AC 396</a> (“<b><em>American Cyanamid</em></b>”) and the requirements, in brief, are two-fold:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that there is a serious question to be tried; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the balance of convenience lies in favour of granting an injunction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">16    I will first deal with the first issue of whether there was a serious question to be tried under the Originating Summons. As was succinctly set out by the High Court in <em>Challenger Technologies</em> at [15] to [17]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[15]   The test laid down in <em>American Cyanamid</em> was whether the claimant had a “real prospect of succeeding in his claim for a permanent injunction at the trial” (at 408). In other words, the claimant has to show that there is a serious issue to be tried. Lord Diplock relevantly said at 407:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">The use of such expressions as ‘a probability,’ ‘a prima facie case,’ or ‘a strong prima facie case’ in the context of the exercise of a discretionary power to grant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion as to the object sought to be achieved by this form of temporary relief. <em>The court no doubt must be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious, in other words, that there is a serious issue to be tried.</em> [emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[16]   This limb was expounded upon by A P Rajah J in <em>Hong Kong Vegetable Oil Co Ltd v Wicker</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1977-1978] SLR(R) 0065.xml')\">[1977–1978] SLR(R) 65</a> at [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Principle 1 ‘provided that the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried, there is no rule that the party seeking an interlocutory injunction must show a prima facie case’. I interpreted this principle to mean that once the court is satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried then the court is not to follow the previous practice of requiring a plaintiff to show a prima facie case before granting him an interim injunction. Therefore, in the instant case I was of the view that I had first to decide whether there is in fact and in law a serious question to be tried and again in my view implicit in ‘a serious question to be tried’ is the question whether the action is properly conceived and whether all the proper, necessary and/or interested parties are before the court so that any order made by the court can properly and effectively be implemented. In my judgment, if these elements or any of them are not present then, because of non-compliance with this principle alone, the motion should stand dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">[17]   The prospects of the plaintiff’s success are to be investigated only to a limited extent: Singapore Civil Procedure 2015 Vol I (G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell, 2015) (“<em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2015</em>”) at para 29/1/12. As is clear from the preceding passages, this is a low threshold and all that has to be seen is whether the plaintiff has prospects of success, which, in substance and reality, exist.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As set out above, the Father’s position was that the Mother was in breach of confidence. Having considered the above, the Father had not clearly shown that there was a serious question to be tried with regards to his claim relating to an action for breach of confidence (of which the Family Court had, in any event, no jurisdiction to hear). The Father’s prayer in SUM 3101 was broadly framed and related to “<em>any confidential documents disclosed and/or filed in Case No. D 2524/2014, or disseminating any further documents disclosed to the Defendant in circumstances imparting a duty of confidence”.</em> Based on this prayer, it was difficult to assess which of the documents imported a quality of confidence, bearing the context in mind that this is a dispute between a former husband and wife on issues relating to jointly owned properties and their Children’s maintenance. The Father mentioned that the Mother had disclosed her written submissions to her current husband. However, he did not demonstrate the “<em>quality of confidence</em>” of such information (particularly the Mother’s own submissions) and why the Mother sending her current husband her submissions was a breach of confidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Moreover, the Father also did not provide sufficient reasons as to why the balance of convenience lay in favour of granting the interlocutory relief that he sought against the Mother. It ought to be reiterated that the manner in which the Father had framed his prayers were broad and lacked precision. For example, the Father’s prayers were vague as to what the “<em>confidential documents disclosed and/or filed in Case No. D 2524/2014”</em> specifically referred to and it was also broad in nature, covering “<em>any electronic devices on or from which the confidential information… and evidence relating thereto, may have been stored and/or disseminated within the possession or control</em>” of the Mother. In the absence of clear reasons from the Father, I could not find that the Father had shown why the balance of convenience lay in favour of the Court granting the interim injunctions sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In view of the foregoing, I dismissed the application in SUM 3101.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 3409</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father referred to his application in SUM 3409 as his “<em>Compliance Application</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Based on his summons, the Father applied for the following orders, which are reproduced below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>i</em>.     <em>“1. The Defendant do comply fully with the Disclosure Order of the Court dated 2 September 2024 (the &quot;</em> <b><em>Disclosure Order</em></b> <em>&quot;), by providing complete sets of the &quot;</em> <b><em>Missing Documents</em></b> <em>&quot; as defined and particularised in Appendix 1A of the affidavit of Marcus Jerome Gordon dated 23 October 2024, filed herein within 14 days of the date of this Further Order.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>ii</em>.     <em>2. The Defendant do file and serve an affidavit containing affirmations consistent with Family Justice Rules, Rule 63(1)(a) and (b) in accordance with the Disclosure Order in respect of each document, or class of documents, that has been disclosed and which the Defendant is no able to disclose, within 14 days of the date of this Further Order.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>iii</em>.     <em>“3. If the Defendant be in default of this Further Order without good cause being shown, the following shall apply:</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>a</em>.     <em>the Variation Application shall be stayed until the Defendant complies with the Disclosure Order and this Further Order;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>b</em>.     <em>the Court shall impose such fines as it deems fit for the Defendant's failure to comply with this Further Order;</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>c</em>.     <em>the Plaintiff's costs arising out of or in connection with the Defendant's failure to comply with the Disclosure Order shall be paid to the Plaintiff on an indemnity basis forthwith; and</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\"> <em>d</em>.     <em>the Defendant shall be held to be in contempt of Court.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>iv</em>.     <em>“4. The Plaintiff shall not be required to file an affidavit responsive to the Defendant's Variation Application pending the Defendant's compliance with the Disclosure Order and this Further Order.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Documents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father and solicitors for the Mother had confirmed that the relevant documents are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Discovery Order;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Mother’s compliance affidavit dated 14 October 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Father’s affidavit filed on 23 October 2024;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Mother’s reply affidavit filed on 15 January 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Father’s affidavit in reply dated 28 January 2025; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Father’s submissions filed on 5 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Positions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In brief, the Father’s main position, as summarised from his relevant written/oral submissions is that the Mother has refused to comply with the Discovery Order and that further orders should be made for her to comply with the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In response, counsel for the Mother made the following submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father did not state which rule or section his application was being made under.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s application for discovery in FC/SUM 2478/2024 had already been heard and orders had already been made under the Discovery Order, rendering the matter <em>res judicata</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother had already filed her Discovery Affidavit (i.e. her compliance affidavit of more than 1000 pages). The Mother’s counsel stressed that the Mother had already produced the documents within her possession and the Father’s application was an abuse of process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     If the Father had an issue with the Mother’s documents, he could make the necessary submissions for the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Mother or file committal proceedings against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Father then made the following claims:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father agreed that the matters pursuant to the Discovery Order were <em>res judicata</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He then cited rule 75 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR 2014</b>”) for the proposition that the Court may make such order as it thinks just if any party fails to comply with an order for discovery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father also made references to the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016. However, he subsequently indicated during the relevant hearing that he was <em>not</em> asking for the Mother to be found in contempt of Court and that he was not expressing an intention to file committal proceedings against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Mother’s counsel then claimed that, while the Father had cited rule 75 of the FJR 2014, he did not show how this had been applied by the Court or how this related to the orders that had been made. The Mother’s counsel also submitted that the Father did not show how the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Rule 75(1) of the FJR 2014, states as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>“75.</b>—(1)    If any party fails to comply with any provision in rules 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 and 74, or with any order made under those rules, or both, as the case may be, then, without prejudice to rule 66(1), the Court may make such order as it thinks just.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The central issue in SUM 3409 is whether the Court should make orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Court should make orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As a starting point, a plain reading of rule 75(1) of the FJR 2014 states that “<em>the Court may make such order that it thinks just</em>”. In the present case, I was not satisfied that the Father had established why the Court should exercise its discretion to make the orders that he had sought, including orders for the Mother to comply with the Discovery Order, or that it would be “<em>just</em>” for the Court to do so. I elaborate on this below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The Father did not establish why the Court should make orders for the Mother to “<em>comply fully</em>” with the Discovery Order under his first prayer. In this regard, the Discovery Order had not been rescinded or set aside. Neither party had filed any appeal against the said Discovery Order. Consequently, such a court order must be complied with. Further orders to declare that the Mother shall comply with the Discovery Order “<em>fully</em>” (as the Father had sought under his first prayer) would be superfluous as she is already compelled under the existing Discovery Order to do so. As such, no further orders would be made as to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Insofar as the Discovery Order was not the subject of an appeal, and it had not been set aside or rescinded, it would also likewise be superfluous for the Court to make a duplicate order for the Mother to file a further affidavit in compliance with the Discovery Order under his second prayer. In consideration of the Mother’s filing of the Discovery Affidavit, the Father did not demonstrate why the Court ought to make a finding that it would be “<em>just</em>” to make a further order for the Mother to file another affidavit to disclose documents in accordance with the Discovery Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I had considered the Father’s claim that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order. I observed that although the Father was of the position that the Mother did not comply with the Discovery Order, and the Mother maintained that she had complied with the same, neither party had sought clarifications from the learned Assistant Registrar who had made the Discovery Order on the said Order. As no clarifications had been sought, the plain wording of the Discovery Order made would stand. Based on the plain wording of the Discovery Order, I was unable to make any definitive findings that the Father had clearly established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order, as demonstrated through the examples that have been set out in table below for illustrative purposes.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"10.82%\"><col width=\"19.82%\"><col width=\"21.62%\"><col width=\"27.02%\"><col width=\"20.72%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>S/No.</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Schedule of Discovery Order</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Brief Summary of Father’s Schedule of “Missing Documents” at Appendix 1A of his affidavit dated 23 October 2024</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Brief Summary of Mother’s Response based on affidavit affirmed on 15 January 2025 / Reference to Mother’s Discovery Affidavit</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court’s Comments</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2 (Table 1): Complete copy of the notification from KF dated 10 November 2023, with attachments. </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father claimed that the Mother did not disclose the Singapore Land Authority (“<b>SLA</b>”) Form referred to in the email dated 29 February 2024 and the attachments. </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Mother had stated in paragraph 18 of her Discovery Affidavit and exhibited at TAB 2, TAB 3 and TAB 10 all the documents and correspondence exchanged with SLA in relation to the procure of the XX Road Tenancy.

In particular, under the Father’s third prayer, the Father prayed that, if the Mother “<em>be in default of this Further Order without good cause being shown</em>”, the following would apply, including that SUM 1993 shall be stayed, the Court shall impose fines on the Mother, costs shall be paid to the Father and the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court. Insofar was the Father’s third prayer was <em>contingent</em> on the Court making further orders under SUM 3409, I did not find that the Father had established a clear legal basis for the Court to grant his third prayer. This is further elaborated upon below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     For the Father’s prayer that the variation application filed by the Mother in SUM 1993 should be stayed, the Father did not demonstrate the legal basis upon which the Court should make orders such that SUM 1993 should be stayed in relation to the present application, particularly since the Father had not established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order and no orders were made under SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father also did not establish why the Court ought to impose a fine on the Mother for the purposes of the present application in SUM 3409, insofar as the Father had failed to demonstrate that the Mother had not complied with the Discovery Order or such “<em>Further Order</em>”, given that no further orders were made pursuant to SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As for the Father’s claim that costs arising out of or in connection with the Mother’s failure to comply with the Discovery Order shall be paid to him on an indemnity basis, no orders were made as to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Furthermore, as for the Father’s prayer that the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court, I note that the Father had indicated in his submissions that he was <em>not</em> asking for the Mother to be found in contempt of Court (which appeared to be contrary to the position that he took in the relevant summons he had filed in SUM 3409). In any event, the Father had not established that the Mother had failed to comply with the Discovery Order. No orders were made in relation to the same. As such, I did not find any clear basis to make any finding that the Mother shall be held to be in contempt of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Finally, the Father sought in his fourth prayer that he shall not be required to file an affidavit in response to SUM 1993 pending the Mother’s compliance with the Discovery Order and the “<em>Further Order”</em>. I did not find a clear basis to make any orders in relation to the Father’s fourth prayer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     In view of the above, I dismissed the Father’s application in SUM 3409.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Having considered the cost submissions of both parties, the number of affidavits filed by the Father and the Mother, the complexity of the issues raised in SUM 3101 and SUM 3409, the number of contested issues, the length of the arguments made by the parties, the written submissions filed, the number of court attendances by the parties (including the attendances of the Mother’s solicitors on record during the relevant hearings), as well as the overall conduct of the parties, the following orders are made in respect of the following applications based on the facts and circumstances of the above matter(s):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     in respect of SUM 3101, the Father is to pay the Mother costs of $1,500 (all-in); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     in respect of SUM 3409, the Father is to pay the Mother costs of $1,500 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I acknowledge that parties are not on the best terms and I sincerely hope that both parties make concerted efforts or explore counselling to rebuild and repair their relationship as co-parents for the welfare of their Children. There is still a possibility for parties to make concerted efforts to work on being kinder and gentler to each other in the best interests of the Children, who need the support of both of their parents in their lives.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Conflict of Laws – Natural forum – Whether divorce proceedings in Singapore ought to be stayed based on forum non conveniens","Domicile – Accommodation – Relevance to determination of domicile – Whether failure to own immoveable assets in Singapore negates intention to settle in this country","Habitual residence – Whether mere possibility of cessation of employment negates habitual residence","Family Law – Divorce – Stay of proceedings – Divorce proceedings in Singapore and France – Parties and their children are French citizens and have resided in Singapore for 10 years – Wife is working in Singapore and the children are studying in the French International School – Husband recently returned to France permanently – French courts obliged to apply Singapore law if they were to adjudicate on divorce and ancillary matters – Whether France is more appropriate forum to determine these matters – Whether divorce proceeding in Singapore should be stayed"],"date":"2025-10-30","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OAD 992 of 2025, FC/SUM 1182/2025, FC/SUM 1884/2025, FC/SUM 2290/2025","title":"XSX v XSY","citation":"[2025] SGFC 110","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34008-SSP.xml","counsel":["Nurul Nabilah & Rebecca Chia (M/s JCP Law LLC) for the Husband","Sukhmit Singh & Isabel Ho (M/s Damodara Ong LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-11-04T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XSX v XSY</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSX <em>v</em> XSY </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34008-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 110</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Wife opposed the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After considering the matter, I dismissed the application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties married in France in September 2015. One month later, the Wife came to Singapore to work here. (She was pregnant with the second child at the material time.) In December 2015, the Husband and the first child joined her in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       From the start of the marriage, the Wife had been the sole breadwinner, while the Husband took care of the children and the household. This arrangement continued until about 2021, when the Husband started to work. He became unemployed in May 2025. According to the Husband, it was difficult for him to find work here because (a) he was a foreigner and (b) his diploma certificate was not widely recognised here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In February 2025, the Wife commenced divorce proceeding in Singapore (“<b>Singapore proceeding</b>”). About two to three months later,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the Husband commenced divorce proceeding in France (“<b>French proceeding</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       At the time of this judgement –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Wife and the children are residing in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is in Singapore on an employment pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The children have dependant passes and are studying at the French International School.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband had left Singapore permanently for France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties’ case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In May 2025, the Husband applied to stay the Singapore proceeding.

According to the Husband, this is evidenced by the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       They were not Singapore permanent residents (“<b>PR</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       They had been living in rental apartments throughout their entire stay in Singapore and did not own any immovable assets here.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The children were enrolled in the International French School under the French curriculum. This was to enable them to assimilate more smoothly into the French educational system when they eventually return to France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The Wife had joined a social security scheme which included a retirement pension in France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The only connection between the Wife and the children to Singapore was her employment here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       If her employment pass were to be terminated, they would have to leave Singapore within 30 days.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Her employer was an internal design agency with operations in other countries.

This is because Singapore is the country of domicile for the children and her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> She relied on the following to support her contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The parties and the children had been residing in Singapore since 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For the past 10 years, the Wife had been on a local employment contract (as opposed to an expatriate contract) with no end date for the employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     She had subscribed to a 20-year local retirement plan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The children had been attending school in Singapore. Their welfare, healthcare, educational, spiritual and other needs would be better served here than in France. Singapore has a relatively large French community. The first child has two more years before he completes his international baccalaureate programme in Singapore. The Wife had no intention “presently” to move any of the children to France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_e\"></a>(e)     It would be more convenient and cheaper to have the divorce and ancillary matters heard in Singapore given that the evidence is here.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s applications to admit further evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     During the hearing, the Wife made two applications to admit further evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">SUM 1884/2025 (“SUM 1884”) – Affidavit on Foreign Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In August 2025, the Wife applied to admit an Affidavit on Foreign Law by her French solicitor, Sabrine Cazorla (“<b>Ms Sabrine</b>”). The affidavit contained the following legal opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>French divorce laws</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There are three stages to divorce proceedings in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Stage 1: The court will determine whether it has jurisdiction over the matter.

If appropriate, it will also make orders relating to spousal maintenance and child arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Stage 3: The matrimonial assets will be distributed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Divorce proceedings can take about 28 months (without appeal) and up to seven to 10 years (in the most contested cases) to conclude.

The duty to maintain a spouse ceases when the divorce is made final.

This is because the Singapore proceeding was initiated – and the divorce papers were properly served on the Husband – <em>before</em> the French proceeding commenced.

The inquiry is directed at identifying the jurisdiction with which the matter has the most real and substantial connection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Stage 2 – If the court is satisfied that another forum is clearly more appropriate, then the burden shifts to the respondent to show that there are <em>“special reasons”</em> for requiring the matter to be tried in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Let me elaborate on how our courts have applied the above analysis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Stage 1 – Whether another jurisdiction is clearly more suitable</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">High threshold</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Under Stage 1, the applicant has the burden to prove that a foreign court is “<em>clearly or distinctly</em> more appropriate” than a Singapore court to determine the parties divorce and ancillary matters. There are several reasons for this high threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, a stay application invites the Singapore court to abstain from exercising a jurisdiction that it otherwise possesses. Such an abstention – in favour of a foreign court – must therefore rest on compelling reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, granting a stay may deprive the respondent of access to the Singapore courts for relief. Persons who have resided and integrated in Singapore should not be required to litigate abroad – incurring additional expense and inconvenience – unless the connecting factors, on balance, clearly points elsewhere.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Connecting factors</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In assessing whether another jurisdiction is clearly more suitable, courts will consider the strength of the factors that connect the parties to the jurisdiction. These factors can be broadly classified into two categories.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Personal connecting factors.</em> These include nationality, domicile, and habitual residence of the parties and their children. The place of marriage is ordinarily a neutral factor: <em>XPI v XPJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33602-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 77</a> (“<b><em>XPI</em></b>”) at [14]; <em>XFS v XFT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32700-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 1</a> (“<b><em>XFS</em></b>”) at [43] to [45]; <em>TPH v TPI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19030-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGFC 72</a> (“<b><em>TPH</em></b>”) at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>General connecting factors.</em> These include the location of third-party witnesses, evidence, and matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Connecting factors carry different weight</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The assessment of whether to allow a stay application is not a mathematical exercise – i.e., the assessment is not to be done by simply comparing the <em>number</em> of connecting factors in favour of Singapore and the other jurisdiction. This is because these factors do not carry the same weight in family proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As a general overview, an analysis of the precedents where at least one party to a divorce proceeding is a foreign citizen reveals the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The personal connecting factors typically carry greater weight than the general connecting factors. In most cases, the latter plays a secondary role in the assessment of stay applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Among the personal connecting factors –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Nationality is typically viewed as the weakest indicator of connection to a jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Courts tend to give more weight to the party’s place of current habitual residence than to his/her place of domicile.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I will now elaborate on the above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Nationality </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Nationality is ordinarily considered to be the weakest of the personal connecting factors: <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> (“<b><em>BDA</em></b>”) at [29]. There are various reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, global mobility has eroded the value of nationality to signify a party’s attachment to a country. In a world of transnational employment and marriages, a party’s nationality often bears little relationship to where his/her family life is centred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, dual or multiple citizenships are increasingly common: <em>BDA</em> at [29].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the weakness of nationality as a connecting factor is also evident from the fact that the Women’s Charter 1960 (“<b>Charter</b>”) does not list it as a jurisdictional basis for divorce. Instead, the Charter stipulates domicile and habitual residence as the grounds for exercising jurisdiction. The Charter further provides that “a person who is a <em>citizen</em> of Singapore is deemed, until the contrary is proved, to be <em>domiciled</em> in Singapore” (emphasis added): see s 93(1) and s 3(5) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Domicile </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Domicile refers to the country that a party treats as his/her permanent home. It may be one of (a) origin (i.e., acquired at birth based on his/her father’s or mother’s domicile), (b) dependence (this usually applies to minors who take on the domicile of the person that they depend on), or (c) choice: <em>Peters Roger May v Pinder Lillian Gek Lian</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0381.xml')\">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 381</a> (“<b><em>Peters Roger May</em></b>”) at [15] to [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     To establish a domicile of choice, a party must show both (a) actual residence in a country and (b) an intention to reside there permanently or indefinitely: <em>XPI</em> at [14]; <em>XFS</em> at [43] to [45]; <em>TPH</em> at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     At this juncture, I digress to make the following observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, evidence showing whether a party had applied for PR status in Singapore – as well as the explanation for making/not making the application – is a relevant, though not conclusive, indicator of whether he/she has the requisite intention. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       An application for PR may indicate a wish to settle long term. On the other hand, there may also be other motivations for the application – e.g., for convenience to facilitate employment, schooling, or property ownership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The decision not to apply for PR may stem from practical considerations, e.g., the party does not want to go through the inconvenience of the application. Thus, the failure to apply for PR does not necessarily negate the intention to settle in Singapore indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, domicile can be a less reliable indicator of the most appropriate forum to hear a divorce application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>Evidential</em>. Intention to reside permanently is subjective and must be inferred from conduct and statements. Such evidence is often equivocal or self-serving. Further, intentions can also shift rapidly with changing and unexpected circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Practical.</em> It is settled law that domicile of origin is retained until displaced. This may lead to artificial results. A person may have lived and worked in Singapore for many years yet remain legally domiciled elsewhere simply because the intention to remain indefinitely cannot be proved to a high degree of certainty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Conceptual.</em> Domicile looks backward to a party’s attachment to a place <em>historically</em> (domicile by origin) or in the <em>distant future</em> (domicile of choice). This analysis is conceptually difficult to apply when dealing with stay applications which require an assessment of where that party’s family life is centred <em>presently</em> and in the <em>foreseeable future</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Habitual residence </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Next, I turn to habitual residence. A person is habitually resident in a place if he/she has voluntarily and continuously lived there for one or more “settled purposes” such as employment, education, or family life: <em>Lee Mei-Chih v Chang Kuo-Yuan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 1115.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 1115</a> (“<b><em>Lee Mei-Chih</em></b>”) at [6] to [8].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The indicators of a “settled purpose” include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Immigration status</em>. The fact that a person is applying for PR status, long-term visit pass, or employment pass indicates his/her legal intention to continue living in Singapore for a sustained duration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Employment</em>. A stable, ongoing source of livelihood in Singapore is a strong indicator of habitual residence. Conversely, short-term consultancy work, remote overseas postings, or roles tied to a fixed project timeline indicate transience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Family.</em> When a person’s immediate family – particularly his/her spouse and children – are settled in Singapore, this can be a powerful indicator of habitual residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Education.</em> Other factors that can indicate whether a party intends to remain in Singapore for some time include his/her <em>choice</em> of school for the children (e.g., whether they are enrolled in a local school or an international school). His/her <em>reasons</em> for the choice – e.g., enrolling the children an international school because of his/her distrust in local pedagogy, desire to reflect a certain socio-economic status, or lack of priority in a local school – is also a relevant consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Housing.</em> The fact that a party has secured long-term housing arrangements – whether ownership or extended leases – can also indicate a desire for sustained residence in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     At this stage, the following points bears highlighting.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is important to distinguish between the assessment of whether a party is habitually resident in Singapore for the purpose of determining (1) stay applications and (2) divorce applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The former scenario involves a forward-centric inquiry – i.e., whether the party is likely to continue residing in Singapore <em>in the future</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The latter scenario, on the other hand, is a backward-centric inquiry. In marriages where both parties are foreign citizens, Singapore courts will have jurisdiction to hear divorce applications only if either of them has been “habitually resident in Singapore for a period of 3 years <em>immediately preceding</em> the commencement of the proceedings”: s 93(1)(b) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, unlike domicile, habitual residence does not require proof of an intention to stay permanently. Residence may be “habitual” even if intended for a fixed term: <em>Lee Mei-Chih</em> at [6] to [8]. Thus, a person may be said to be habitually residing in Singapore even if he/she (i) intends to return to his/her country of origin after the employment here ends, or (ii) has not obtained Singapore PR status: <em>WJK v WJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29118-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 85</a> at [26] to [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, in the context of stay applications, the jurisdiction where the parties’ children are located <em>currently and in the future</em> is clearly better suited to deal with issues relating to their custody, care, control, access, and maintenance. This is because that jurisdiction –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Will have a better understanding of the social norms and environmental factors in the children’s upbringing and what is in their best interests and welfare: <em>XLV v XLW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33343-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 35</a> (“<b><em>XLV</em></b>”) at [46]; <em>Low Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon Leigh</em> [1999] 3 SLR(R) 991 (“<b><em>Low Wing Hong</em></b>”) at [20]; <em>USE v USF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22723-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 8</a> (“<b><em>USE</em></b>”) at [12]; <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/4206-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 60</a> at [4]; <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17919-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 982</a> (“<b><em>TDX</em></b>”) at [15]; <em>WYZ v WZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32014-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 68</a> at [17], and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Can also obtain evidence directly and expeditiously from the children to deal with his/her care, control and other issues. This may be contrasted with the case where the children are in another jurisdiction. In the latter case, there may be a need to seek the permission and assistance of that jurisdiction to conduct a child interview or prepare a child evaluation report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Habitual residence carries greater weight</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given [28] and [31(c)] above, a party’s place of habitual residence clearly has advantages – when compared to domicile – as a consideration for assessing stay applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Indeed, Singapore courts have <em>recognised habitual residence</em> to be a significant factor in assessing stay applications: see, e.g., <em>Lee Mei-Chih</em> at [5] and [6]; <em>XLV</em> at [37] to [40]; <em>Helen Diane Womersley v Nigel Maurice Womersley</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22316-M.xml')\">[2003] SGDC 186</a> (“<b><em>Womersley</em></b>”) at [11].

He submitted that because both parties are French citizens, France was their domicile of origin. This domicile has not been displaced, and French courts were therefore the more appropriate forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife argued that France was no longer her domicile of origin as Singapore was her domicile of choice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife is residing in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     To establish a domicile of choice, the Wife must prove two elements: (a) that her residence in Singapore is not temporary or transitory, and (b) that she intends to make Singapore her home permanently or indefinitely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The first element is clearly satisfied. The Wife had resided continuously in Singapore for the past ten years and remains here at the date of this judgment. Her employment, residence, and family life are all based in Singapore. Her presence here is clearly not transient.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife failed to prove requisite intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The difficulty with the Wife’s case lies in the second requirement – i.e., whether she has formed a settled intention to make Singapore her permanent home. I find the evidence on this to be equivocal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The most significant evidence supporting an intention to reside in Singapore permanently is the Wife’s purchase of a Manulife endowment and retirement plan (“<b>Manulife Plan</b>”) in 2021. Under this plan, she undertook to pay premiums for ten years and to receive payouts in Singapore dollars from age 60 for a twenty-year period (2042–2062).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The weight of the Manulife Plan is however weakened by the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Husband contended that the Wife had purchased the Manulife Plan only because a similar product was unavailable in France.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       It is not disputed that the Wife can receive payouts under the plan even if she were to return to France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Wife continues to contribute to a French social-security scheme that includes a retirement pension.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> This can suggest that she intends to retire in France.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       The children are enrolled in the International French School under the French curriculum. The Husband claimed, without rebuttal by the Wife, that this is to facilitate the children’s reintegration into the French educational system if needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       The Wife did not apply for PR status in Singapore,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> claiming that she would accept PR “if offered”. Neither did she provide an explanation for failing to apply for PR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Taken cumulatively, the factors in (b) above may suggest that the Wife has not yet formed a settled intention to make Singapore her permanent home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For completeness, I find the fact that the family has lived in rented premises for the past decade to be a neutral factor on whether the Wife has made Singapore her permanent home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, while home ownership can suggest an intention to remain in a jurisdiction permanently, its absence is not determinative. This is because home ownership in Singapore is costly and subject to eligibility restrictions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife explained that she had been saving to purchase an apartment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Her explanation has not been contradicted by evidence to the contrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Place of habitual residence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Next, I considered whether the Wife and the children are habitually resident in Singapore for the purpose of the stay application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In this regard, it is common ground that the parties and their children have been habitually resident in Singapore for the past 10 years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> The issue is whether the Wife and the children are likely to continue to be habitually resident in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband contended that the answer is “no” because the family’s continued residence in Singapore depends on the Wife’s employment, and the employment “can cease at any time”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I am unable to accept the Husband’s contention. In my view, a party may be found to be habitually resident in Singapore even if his/her right to remain here is conditional on employment that may, in theory, be terminated. Let me elaborate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Husband’s contention effectively means that a foreigner can be said to be habitually resident in Singapore only if there is no risk of him/her being terminated whatsoever. I find this to be unreasonable and contrary to case law. To establish habitual residence, the law requires only that the party intends to remain in a place for one or more settled purposes. Such a purpose includes employment: see [30(b)] above. There is <em>no additional requirement</em> that the person must also possess a legal right to remain permanently. Indeed, under Art 13 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, only Singapore citizens enjoy an absolute right of abode.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If the mere possibility of job termination is sufficient to negate habitual residence, then no foreigner can ever be said to be habitually resident in Singapore, however settled his life in this country may be. That outcome is both unrealistic and contrary to established jurisprudence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, the evidence clearly shows that the lives of the Wife and the children will remain to be centred in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>The Wife</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife currently holds a well-paying job and is in a senior management position. There is no evidence of her having an intention to resign. Neither is there any evidence that she will be transferred to the sister company in France: see [8(c)(ii)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Wife had subscribed to the Manulife Plan in 2021. Under the plan, she undertook to pay premiums for ten years. She has done so for the past four years and remains bound for another six. This long-term financial commitment, denominated in Singapore dollars, reflects an intention to remain anchored here for a significant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>The children</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it is unlikely that the Wife will uproot the children and relocate them to France anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The children are schooling in Singapore. Their education is likely to anchor both them and the Wife in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       This is especially so for the older child, aged 16, who is currently enrolled in the international baccalaureate programme. He will complete the programme only until 2027.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Finally, it is also unlikely that the children will relocate to France to live with the Husband. He has only recently resettled in there and is still seeking stable employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     To sum-up, on the totality of the evidence, I find that the Wife and the children will continue to be habitually resident in Singapore for the next several years.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether France is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Given my finding in [47] and [48], as well as the considerations in [28] and [31] to [33] above, I am of the view that the Husband has failed to demonstrate that France is <em>clearly or distinctly more appropriate</em> than Singapore to determine the divorce and ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     This view is reinforced by the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, a key part of the divorce hearing will involve looking into issues such as the children’s needs as well as how the parties will be able to care for and maintain them. The parties’ employment and financial circumstances will be important factors in this regard. Three of the four persons who can provide material evidence on these issues – the Wife and the two children – are residing in Singapore. This is a consideration that can further tip the balance in favour of the Singapore courts determining the divorce issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, Ms Sabrine’s opinion is that even if the French courts were to hear the divorce, they would be obliged to apply Singapore law: see [11(j)] above. The Husband did not dispute this opinion.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Given the above, it is plainly counter-intuitive to stay the Singapore proceeding. At risk of stating the obvious, Singapore courts are better placed to apply Singapore laws.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Furthermore, if the Singapore proceeding is stayed, both parties will have to adduce expert evidence on Singapore law before the French courts. This will increase costs and prolong the proceedings there. This is not in either party’s interest. This is especially so for the Husband, as it is unclear whether he can afford such costs given that he is still seeking stable employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Other points</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     For completeness, I will address two other points.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52      <em>First</em>, I found that the location of matrimonial assets is a neutral factor in this case. It is undisputed that the parties do not own immovable property in either Singapore or France. Additionally, the mere fact that the parties held savings plans and a life insurance policy in France<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> does not, on its own, establish that the French courts is the more appropriate forum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> The Husband has not explained why the Singapore courts will be unable to deal with such assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53      <em>Second</em>, the Husband submitted that France is the more appropriate forum because enforcement of maintenance orders would be easier there, since his income and assets are in that jurisdiction. To support his submission, he cited from <em>BDA</em> where – according to the Husband – the High Court “placed significant weight on where the payer-husband was residing and working at the material time (i.e. Singapore)”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> I am not persuaded by the Husband’s submission. <em>One</em>, it is speculative what form of maintenance order, if any, will ultimately be made against the Husband. <em>Two</em>, the Husband’s reliance on <em>BDA</em> is unmeritorious.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There is nothing in the judgement to show that the High Court there had set aside the stay application imposed by the district court because the husband was working and resident in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In fact, it appears from [33] of its judgement that a key reason why the High Court had set aside the stay application is that the wife and the son <em>had been residing</em> in Singapore and <em>intended to return to live in Singapore</em>. (She was apparently in India at the time of the hearing.) This supports the view that the place of habitual residence is an important consideration on whether to stay a divorce proceeding. In the present case, the evidence shows that the Wife and the children will be staying in Singapore for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For the above reasons, I find that the Husband had failed to prove that France is “clearly or distinctly more appropriate” than Singapore to adjudicate the parties’ divorce and ancillary matters. The Wife should not be denied access to the Singapore courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Given the above finding, there is no need for me to proceed to Stage 2 of the <em>Spiliada</em> analysis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Accordingly, I dismissed the Husband’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>______________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u><font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">annex a</font></u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><font style=\"text-transform: uppercase;\">Habitual Residence and Stay Applications</font></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1_1\"></a>1       Examples where the care-giver parent and children were <em>habitually resident</em> in Singapore at the time of the judgement – Stay application dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>TAR</em> – The wife (Indian citizen) and her six-year-old child (British citizen) had been residing in Singapore for about four years.

District Judge Eugene Tay:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is the Defendant husband’s appeal against my decision to grant a judgment of judicial separation for the Plaintiff wife on 28 August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts and proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Parties were married on 25 January 2004 in India. There are no children to the marriage. At the time of the hearing, parties were both 49 years of age, and the Plaintiff was residing in Singapore while the Defendant was residing in the United States of America (“US”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 29 April 2024, the Plaintiff filed an application for judicial separation on the basis that the marriage has irretrievably broken down in that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 9 July 2024, the Defendant filed an application for stay of the proceedings on the grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> in FC/SUM 2145/2024 (“SUM 2145”) on the basis that India is the more appropriate forum to determine the dissolution of the marriage. SUM 2145 was subsequently dismissed on 18 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Thereafter, the Defendant filed his Defence on 2 December 2024, and the Plaintiff filed her reply on 16 December 2024. Parties subsequently filed their respective Affidavits-of-Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) on 4 March 2025, and the matter was fixed for trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The trial took place on 14 May 2025. Apart from parties’ respective AEICs, the Plaintiff relied on an additional set of documents of 306 pages containing parties’ chat history (“PS1”), which the Defendant did not object to. After the trial, parties were directed to file and serve written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 28 August 2025, I delivered my decision and granted a judgment of judicial separation. After hearing parties on costs, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of the trial fixed at $8,000.00 (all-in). I also directed parties to file and exchange their respective Affidavits of Assets and Means (“AOM”) by 9 October 2025, with a window period until 11 September 2025 for parties to correspond with each other on whether to attend mediation and/or for the AOMs to be held in abeyance, and for the matter to be fixed for a case conference for parties to seek the necessary directions from the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 11 September 2025, the Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal against the whole of my decision. The grounds for my decision are set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Plaintiff’s Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In the Plaintiff’s AEIC, she summarised the incidents where she claimed the Defendant had behaved unreasonably, as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>a.     His failure to appreciate her efforts and sacrifices in the marriage and led to her feeling undervalued and neglected;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>b.     His denial of her repeated requests for physical intimacy and affection;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>c.     His deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_d\"></a>d.     His secretive behaviour which led to mistrust between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions, the Plaintiff stated that her case for the Court to grant the judgment for judicial separation is based on the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>a.     The lack of physical intimacy in the marriage, due to his refusal to respond to her repeated requests for intimacy and affection;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>b.     His failure to prioritise spending time with her which caused her to feel hurt and unwanted;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>c.     His deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>d.     His secretive behaviour towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Plaintiff also submitted that the Defendant’s overall conduct throughout this case demonstrates how he consistently misled her into believing that their marriage remained intact, when to his mind, he considered parties to have been separated in November 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Defendant’s Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Defendant denied the Plaintiff’s allegations and submitted that she had not proven her case. While he agreed that the marriage has broken down, he denied that it was due to his unreasonable behaviour. He claimed that she is making false allegations of his unreasonable behaviour to gain a tactical advantage in the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The main thrust of the Defendant’s defence is that parties have been separated since 2018, and this serves as an important backdrop to the state of parties’ relationship from then onwards. He claimed that parties have been separated since 2018 and no longer behaved as a married couple since. As such, it is understandable that their relationship and interactions with each other since 2018 would not be one that is typical for a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under section 101(1) of the Women’s Charter (“WC”), either party to a marriage may apply for judicial separation on the ground and circumstances set out in then-section 95(3) of the WC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>, and then-section 95 of the WC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> applies (with the necessary modifications) in relation to an application for judicial separation as they apply to an application for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The main issue in this case is whether the Plaintiff has proven on balance of probabilities that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Case authorities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> have established that the question whether the Plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the Defendant must be answered subjectively, and in dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the Plaintiff can reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant. It is for the Court to answer this, using an objective test, having regard to the personalities of the individuals before it. The Court must also look at behaviour by taking into account the cumulative effect of the behaviour, and any conduct, active or passive constitutes behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In <em>Elements of Family Law in Singapore</em> by Leong Wai Kum (“<em>Elements</em>”), the learned author suggested that the understanding of whether the marriage has irretrievably broken down need not be as rigorous for an application for judicial separation since the relief does not involve the termination of the marriage with finality, as compared with a divorce which terminates the marital relationship with finality<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In the Family Court case of <em>USC v USD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22740-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 6</a> (“<em>USC</em>”), the Court adopted the aforesaid approach proposed in <em>Elements</em>, and took the view that there should be greater allowances for a judgment of judicial separation (compared to divorce) as a judicial separation is, loosely speaking, a step below divorce<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The Court in <em>USC</em> also took the view that adopting a less stringent threshold meant doing so in terms of the impact of the alleged unreasonable behaviour, and that once the Court is satisfied that a plaintiff’s contentions are established, the Court should be more inclined to grant a plaintiff’s application for judicial separation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Finally, under sections 139E and 139F of the WC, the Court is to consider the possibility of reconciliation between parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether parties had separated since 2018 and lived separate lives</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I first deal with the Defendant’s claim that parties have been separated since 2018, which is the main thrust of his Defence, as this will have a bearing on how the Court should view incidents and/or the Defendant’s alleged behaviour in determining whether he has behaved in such a way that it is unreasonable for the Plaintiff to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Defendant cited various factors<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> to refute the Plaintiff’s assertion given during the trial that parties had gradually reconciled after a trial separation period starting from June 2018 and had behaved like a normal couple. These factors included the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>a.     Parties selling the matrimonial home and decoupling their assets in 2019;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>b.     Living under a pretence towards the Plaintiff’s family in India in 2021;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>c.     Lack of holidays between 2019 to 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_d\"></a>d.     Discussion about lawyers and parents in 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_e\"></a>e.     No celebration of anniversary in 2023;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_f\"></a>f.     The Defendant’s declaration to his employer in the US in December 2022 that he was single, and that the Plaintiff knew about this declaration;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_g\"></a>g.     That the Plaintiff (allegedly) had no intention to live with him in the US; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_h\"></a>h.     The Defendant’s romantic relationship with others between 2018 to 2023 (which the Plaintiff is aware of).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Defendant also submitted that the chatlogs from 2020 to 2023 (in PS1) containing the communication between parties showed that their relationship was a platonic one, more akin to friends than a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Plaintiff submitted that the nature and frequency of parties’ exchanges and ongoing interactions goes far beyond casual or obligatory communication and reflects the engagement and familiarity in an active relationship, rather than a couple on the path to separation. She also submitted that while it is undisputed that parties have been living separately, the evidence suggests a lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate; on the contrary, their actions and interactions indicate an ongoing connection that does not align with a definitive separation up until December 2023. She also stated that even after January 2023, parties continued to update each other on their lives and communicated on random and mundane things on a regular basis, which went beyond minimal or necessary communication for a couple who had allegedly separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     From the evidence, the manner in which parties had conducted themselves and treated and communicated with each other since the initial trial separation in June 2018 gave rise to questions and ambiguity whether they had remained separate and no longer regarded each other as spouses, or whether they had after the trial separation reconciled and carried on their relationship as a married couple.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Having considered the evidence, my findings are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>a.     It is firstly undisputed that parties have been living separately;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>b.     It is also not disputed that parties decided to have a 3-month trial separation starting from June 2018;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>c.     The frequency, nature and contents of parties’ contacts and communication (as can be seen from the history of messages between parties in PS1) would go beyond mere platonic friendship, and would instead be more consistent with and indicative of the fact that parties were still interacting and functioning as a married couple after the trial separation;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_d\"></a>d.     The Plaintiff is aware that the Defendant is seeing and living with another woman during the period of alleged separation and seemed quite prepared to accept this, so long as she (the Plaintiff) remained and retained her status as his wife. The fact that the Defendant was seeing someone else during this period does not necessarily mean (at least in the Plaintiff’s mind) that parties are formally separated and no longer regarded or conducted themselves as husband and wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_e\"></a>e.     Even if the Defendant believed in his mind that parties had separated and were only platonic friends, the regularity, frequency and nature of his interactions and communications with the Plaintiff and his failure to draw clear boundaries and/or clarify the status of their relationship would have led to her having the belief and be under the impression that their relationship after the trial separation had resumed as husband and wife. For example, he did not correct her on at least three (3) separate occasions on 17 January 2022, 28 September 2022 and 2 October 2022 when she referred to herself as “wife”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. He also did not correct her on 28 May 2021 when she told him that he was the beneficiary for her ICICI account and that it was wrongly written “wife” and that he should be “husband”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, the Defendant also testified during the trial that even after November 2018, parties (according to him) were moving towards a separate relationship even in 2020, 2021 and 2022. This is inconsistent with his claim that parties were separated by November 2018 and there was no marital relationship. His subsequent attempt to explain that this was a reinforcement of the separation in 2018 was unconvincing and somewhat contrived. All it did was to weaken his claim that parties were separated after November 2018. If indeed parties were already separated by November 2018, there would have been no need to “move towards” a separate relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Overall, on balance, I found that after the trial separation in 2018, parties had thereafter behaved and conducted themselves and treated each other in a manner more consistent as spouses in an existing marriage, instead of individuals who had separated and were merely platonic friends. I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that while it is undisputed that parties have been living separately, the evidence suggests a lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate. Following from this, I found that parties were not actually separated after the trial separation, and still behaved and interacted and conducted themselves as spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In light of this finding, I now move on to deal with the Plaintiff’s specific allegations of the Defendant’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Lack of physical intimacy due to the Defendant’s refusal to respond to the Plaintiff’s repeated requests</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant had refused her requests for physical intimacy since 2012. However, there is lack of evidence to support her claims that she had repeatedly requested physical intimacy from the Defendant and that he had repeatedly denied her requests, in particular from 2012 to 2014. In addition, the Plaintiff acknowledged during the trial that there were little opportunities for parties to be intimate since they lived in different countries since 2014. She also testified that parties did not show much romantic behaviour after marriage, as they were not “that kind of people”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Overall, I found the Plaintiff’s allegation that she had made repeated requests for the Defendant for physical intimacy and that he had repeatedly denied her requests to be unproven. I did not think that lack of physical intimacy between parties could be attributed solely to the Defendant, let alone that this would constitute unreasonable behaviour on his part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s failure to prioritise spending time with the Plaintiff, causing her to feel hurt and unwanted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to prioritise spending time with her, causing her to feel hurt and unwanted. She cited two (2) incidents in in support of her allegation. The first is the Defendant’s refusal to make a brief stop-over in Singapore during his trip to India in April 2022 to visit his mother on his way back to Japan (“First Incident”). The second is the Defendant not meeting the Plaintiff in the Philippines in September 2022 (“Second Incident”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the First Incident, the Whatsapp messages the Plaintiff had relied on<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> were only extracts and did not show a more complete picture of parties’ communication at the material time. In particular, there were no messages exhibited showing when the Plaintiff had requested the Defendant to make a detour to Singapore on his way back to Japan after visiting his mother in India. The extract of the messages only provided a brief screenshot of the Defendant informing the Plaintiff of his travel schedule from 8 April 2022 to 3 May 2022, and the Plaintiff acknowledging that he would not come back to Singapore on his way back. If the Defendant had already booked his flights prior to the Plaintiff making the request for him to make a detour to Singapore, I did not think he can be faulted for not acceding to her request. Further, it is not clear from the messages that the Plaintiff had communicated her feelings and/or expressed her disappointment to the Defendant of his failure to visit her in Singapore in April 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     For the Second Incident, while the Plaintiff may have felt disappointed, suffice to say it appeared from the Whatsapp messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> that the fact that parties did not meet in the end was essentially due to miscommunication and scheduling, instead of the Defendant not prioritising spending time with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Insofar as the Plaintiff relied on these two (2) incidents in April 2022 and September 2022 of the Defendant not meeting her, it is insufficient for me to arrive at the conclusion that he had failed to prioritise spending time with her by not meeting her in those two (2) occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     At this juncture, I pause to note what the Plaintiff had testified in Court when asked why it took her so many years to file the present application when the marriage has not been really good since 2009. She had testified that the issues that happened since 2009 onwards were “ups and downs of marital life” and were “not enough to warrant a divorce”, and that it was in “2023, 2024 when things escalated out of hand”. Pertinently she admitted that if the 2023, 2024 incidents did not happen, it was possible she might not have filed this application. She further stated that the 2023 incident is the Defendant refusing to apply for a US dependent pass visa for her and deceived her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, it can be inferred that the incidents and the Defendant’s behaviour prior to the issue relating to the US visa application in 2023 would not by themselves have been behaviour that had affected the Plaintiff such that it would compel her to apply for judicial separation or divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from the Plaintiff </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Plaintiff’s allegation of the Defendant’s deliberate attempt to exclude or remove himself from her essentially relates to his refusal to have her join him in the US in 2023, specifically not proceeding to apply for US dependent pass visa for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I noted the Defendant did not outrightly refuse the Plaintiff’s request for him to apply for a US visa for her by telling her that they are separated and no longer considered husband and wife. Rather, he gave various reasons, including settling accommodation, buying a car and catching up with work. It was apparent that from January 2023 to June 2023, he did not explicitly make it clear to the Plaintiff that he was not going to support her visa application. When asked during the trial if he agreed that he never told the Plaintiff from January 2023 to June 2023 that he was not going to support her application, the Defendant responded by saying he did not explicitly say that, and that parties were already separated, and he did not believe in a paper marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     However, it was telling that the Defendant admitted under cross-examination that even in August 2023, he was giving the Plaintiff the impression that both of them were working on the method to get the Plaintiff a US visa. He also admitted that after he had filed for divorce in India on 5 August 2023, he continued to engage the Plaintiff about trying to apply for the US visa for her, and did not inform her of the divorce he had filed in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In my view, the aforesaid behaviour by the Defendant would have led the Plaintiff to have the belief and expectation that parties were planning for her relocation to the US as a married couple and that the Defendant would apply for US dependent pass visa for her, when in fact, he did not have the sincere or genuine intention to do so. As such, I considered the Defendant to have misled the Plaintiff as regards his real reasons for not applying for US visa for her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I should state that I did not see the Defendant’s actions and behaviour as regards the US visa application primarily as deliberately excluding or removing himself from the Plaintiff per se. Rather, I saw this as the Defendant misleading and giving the Plaintiff false expectation and hope that she would be able to relocate to the US to be with him and that parties (him in particular) were working on this. This continued until as late as early August 2023 when the Defendant filed for divorce in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Ultimately, I accepted that the Defendant’s actions and behaviour in this regard would have undermined the Plaintiff’s trust in him and led to a sense of betrayal in her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Defendant’s secretive behaviour towards the Plaintiff </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On the Plaintiff’s allegations of the Defendant’s secretive behaviour towards her, I was of the view that his actions with regard to the US visa application for the Plaintiff as discussed earlier can also be considered secretive behaviour, in that the Defendant had misled her and (up till August 2023) concealed his genuine intentions from her, giving her the impression that this was still in the works while, unbeknownst to her, he had planned and subsequently filed for divorce in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant was secretive by not disclosing his address in the US to her. The Defendant took the position that it was not unreasonable for him not to disclose his US address to the Plaintiff if parties have been separated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I would agree that if parties were still separated and the Plaintiff was aware of the same, then there is some basis for the Defendant’s position. However, given my earlier findings that the evidence suggests lack of clear intention from either party to formally separate, and that parties had behaved and conducted themselves and treated each other in a manner more consistent as spouses in an existing marriage, I did not think the Plaintiff can be faulted for perceiving that the Defendant was being secretive to her by not disclosing his address in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I did not consider the Defendant choosing to designate his secretary as emergency contact (instead of the Plaintiff) as being secretive behaviour as alleged by the Plaintiff, since the Defendant had informed the Plaintiff of this. I also did not consider the Defendant terminating his life insurance policy (in which the Plaintiff was the beneficiary) without informing the Plaintiff as secretive behaviour, since he was the policy holder and has the discretion to deal with the policy as he deems fit (which the Plaintiff had admitted).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Prospect of reconciliation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Finally, I considered the prospect of reconciliation between parties. Suffice to say that give the current state of the relationship between parties, and taking into account the Defendant himself had filed for divorce in India, I did not see any reasonable prospect of reconciliation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summary of findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Overall, while I did not think the Plaintiff has proven all her allegations against the Defendant, I found that the Defendant’s actions with regard to him giving the Plaintiff false expectation and hope of relocating to the US to reunite with him, misleading her on the US visa application and concealing and being secretive of his true intentions would cumulatively amount to behaviour on his part such that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to continue to live with him. I accepted the Plaintiff’s submission that the Defendant’s actions would have undermine her trust, emotional stability and sense of security in the relationship, and there is no longer any affection and trust or meaningful communication between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Finally, I did not think the Defendant has substantiated or proven his claim that the Plaintiff had made false allegations of his unreasonable behaviour to gain a tactical advantage in the ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In conclusion, I found that the Plaintiff has proven that the marriage has broken down irretrievably in that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having noted and applied the less rigorous and stringent approach to viewing alleged unreasonable behaviour as suggested in <em>Elements</em> and adopted in <em>USC</em> at [17] and [18] above, I was satisfied that a judgment of judicial separation on the Plaintiff’s claim should be granted, and I therefore so ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On the issue of costs, the Plaintiff’s solicitors submitted that costs should follow the event and sought costs at $15,000.00 (including disbursements). The Plaintiff’s solicitors informed the Court that there was an Offer to Settle (“OTS”) issued to the Defendant on 26 March 2025 proposing that judicial separation be granted on the Plaintiff’s claim with an offer for the Defendant to file his counter-claim, which the Defendant did not take up. Parties had therefore go through a one (1) day trial and file closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Defendant’s solicitors disagreed on the Plaintiff’s quantum for costs and pointed out that the OTS was issued after parties’ AEICs were exchanged, and that work done after the OTS was issued on 26 March 2025 was mainly for the trial. The Defendant’s solicitors submitted that costs should be around $4,000.00 to $5,000.00, taking into account the OTS as well as last minute work that had to be done because of the 11<sup>th</sup> hour submission of messages (in PS1) before the trial which was not objected to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     After hearing counsel, I ordered the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff costs of the trial fixed at $8,000.00 all-in.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Now section 95A</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Now sections 95 and 95A</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a> at [8] and [13]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup><em>Elements</em> at [6.020]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup><em>USC</em> at [54]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup><em>USC</em> at [55]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Paragraph 15 of the Defendant’s Written Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Page 55 (17/01/2022, 22:27), page 56 (17/01/2022, 22:37), page 120 (28/09/2022, 07:07) and page 124 (02/10/2022, 22:13) of PS1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Page 283 (28/05/2021, 22:35) of PS1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Page 173 of the Plaintiff’s AEIC</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Page 121 of PS1</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Divorce","Family Law – Grounds for divorce – Behaviour"],"date":"2025-10-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 6185 of 2023","title":"XSP v XSQ","citation":"[2025] SGFC 107","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F34007-SSP.xml","counsel":["Gloria James-Civetta, Chong Xin Yi (Liesel), Sheryl Keith Sandhu (Gloria James-Civetta & Co.) for the Plaintiff","Hoon Shu Mei, Beverly Goh (Drew & Napier LLC) for the Defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-11-04T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Edmund Chew","html":"<root><head><title>XSP v XSQ</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSP <em>v</em> XSQ </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/34007-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 107</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Wife is a Singaporean while the Husband is a Singapore Permanent Resident. There are 4 children to the marriage: Amanda, Benny, Caleb, and Damien.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Only the youngest son is still a minor at the time of these divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Prior to the marriage, parties lived and worked in Hong Kong.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> After the parties solemnised their marriage, they continued to live in Hong Kong. Sometime in December 2001, the parties relocated to Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> Parties subsequently started a family business dealing with property development and investments. There were various companies incorporated resulting from this family business, and the key point to note was that the companies used the acronym “ABC”, after the children’s names. This was before the 4<sup>th</sup> child was born in March 2009.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Arising from various unhappiness, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 20 December 2023, claiming that the marriage has broken down irretrievably, relying on s. 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>Women’s Charter</b>”),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> viz., the fact that the Husband has behaved in such a way that she cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard parties over the course of 6 days and dismissed the Wife’s claim for divorce on 24 March 2025. The Wife thereafter sought an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal against my decision and was granted permission on 10 July 2025 by the Family Division of the High Court. The Wife then filed her Notice of Appeal on 11 July 2025 against the whole of my decision given on 24 March 2025. I now provide the grounds of my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       A total of 5 affidavits were filed and 3 witnesses were called, in addition to both parties.

That is the sole ground for divorce. To prove this ground of the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage, parties can rely on one of 5 facts.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span> This is clear from the statutory language of s. 95 of the Women’s Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Irretrievable breakdown of marriage to be sole ground for divorce</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">95.—(1)    Either party to a marriage may file a writ for divorce on the ground that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The court hearing such proceedings shall, so far as it reasonably can, inquire into the facts alleged as causing or leading to the breakdown of the marriage and, if satisfied that the circumstances make it just and reasonable to do so, grant a judgment for its dissolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The court hearing any proceedings for divorce shall not hold the marriage to have broken down irretrievably unless the plaintiff satisfies the court of one or more of the following facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    that the defendant has committed adultery and the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ and the defendant consents to a judgment being granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this case, the Wife has relied solely on the fact in s. 95(3)(b). This fact is commonly referred to as “unreasonable behaviour”. While this is a practical and useful shorthand term, it bears repeating that the unreasonableness analysis is not of the defendant’s behaviour, but the expectation that the plaintiff continues to live with the defendant. In other words, the Wife must prove that the Husband has behaved in such a way that it is unreasonable to expect her to live with him. The Wife bears the burden of proof, and the standard of proof is one on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     It is trite law that the test for “unreasonable behaviour” comprises a subjective component and an objective component. The test is summarised in <em>VTP v VTO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26717-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 36</a> as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The first step is to assess whether the wife found it intolerable to live with the husband. This is subjective. Next, the court should consider whether the wife can reasonably be expected to live with the husband. That is an objective test, but the court may take into account the personalities of the parties in assessing the impact of the behaviour on the other spouse. The husband’s behaviour not only towards the wife, but also in relation to the marriage, is relevant in this inquiry: Castello Ana Paula Costa Fusillier v Lobo Carlos Manuel Rosado <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 4 SLR(R) 0331.xml')\">[2003] 4 SLR(R) 331</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In <em>Wong Siew Boey v Lee Boon Fatt</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1994] 1 SLR(R) 0323.xml')\">[1994] 1 SLR(R) 323</a> (“<b><em>Wong Siew Boey</em></b>”), the Court stated thus<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Whether the respondent’s behaviour has been such that the petitioner can no longer reasonably be expected to live with him is essentially a finding of fact and the courts have avoided categorising conduct as guilty or blameless in the abstract. <b><em>The question whether the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the respondent must be answered subjectively</em></b>: whether his attitude is reasonable is irrelevant. <b><em>In dealing with behaviour, the question is whether the petitioner can reasonably be expected to live with the respondent and it is for the court, and not the petitioner, to answer it.

This is clear from the statutory language of s. 95(6):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support the plaintiff’s allegation, that fact is to be disregarded in determining for the purposes of subsection (3)(<em>b</em>) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Therefore, I bore in mind the above principles as I evaluated the parties’ evidence before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision and Findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged control of the Wife’s finances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I first turn to the first broad category of the Husband’s control of the Wife’s finances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I found that from the time parties were staying in Hong Kong, the parties indeed had a mutual understanding of their respective roles in the marriage. The Husband was the sole breadwinner responsible for bringing in the necessary income to support the parties’ and household expenses, while the Wife was the full-time homemaker responsible for taking care of matters at home and the children, even if this was with the help of helpers. The Wife had conceded this under cross-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> She re-affirmed this under re-examination.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> Even though the Wife had pleaded in her SOP that the Husband “did not have to lift a finger to help in the household and family matters” and “was busy with his work”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> this did not appear to me to be an instance of behaviour that made it unreasonable to expect her to continue living with the Husband. This was the arrangement parties had and the Wife conceded under cross-examination that she “[did] not expect him” to help in these matters and was also “not blaming him”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> She does not deny that the Husband has been a good father and also shares a strong relationship with all 4 children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> While she explains that what she meant was that the Husband did not lift a finger in terms of “physical work”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> she was “not unhappy for him not doing anything”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> and it was enough for her as the Husband did care for the children in his own ways. Even after parties moved to Singapore, I found that this arrangement continued, albeit the Wife expected the Husband to get involved more in the family matters and she conceded that he was indeed very involved.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> In line with this mutual understanding of their roles, it appeared that the Husband similarly managed all the household expenses and finances. It was not disputed that the Husband does check the household transactions, including those of the children, and the Wife was not always unhappy about this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> Against this backdrop, I also found that for the large part of the marriage, and in fact even up to the time the Wife decided to divorce the Husband, it was clear to me that the Wife had always been content to leave all financial matters to the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     While the Wife had also pleaded that the Husband was financially controlling of her and monitored and frequently her credit card spending, it was not disputed that she had only provided 1 example of such control in her evidence before me.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> This was a text message which the Husband sent to the Wife with a photograph of the parties’ joint bank account. In the screenshot, the Husband circled the expense of $4,000 incurred on 22 July 2020 and sent the Wife a message containing just “???”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The Wife explained that this was for a spa package for her mother and herself, and the Husband then asked if this was going to be a regular monthly expense. After the Wife answered in the negative, the parties did not continue the conversation further. In this regard, I read this episode as an example of how the Husband was fulfilling his role as the financial steward of the family, ensuring that the expenses were properly accounted for. The Husband did not ask the Wife to cancel the package, nor did he say that it was unreasonable to incur such an expense. The Wife explained that this was “all text message not conversational” and her understanding was that the Husband was displeased at her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> However, the objective evidence did not bear this out. The conversation simply ended after the Wife gave her explanation. If this was the only example given and the Wife was asking me to draw an inference that this way of responding to text messages was the Husband’s way of questioning and controlling her expenses, that was not an inference I was prepared to draw without any further supporting evidence. The sum incurred would appear to be an out-of-the-ordinary household expense and it was not reasonable for a clarification to be sought as to this expense. The Wife explained that due to the passage of time, she was unfortunately unable to locate the relevant documents to corroborate the other instances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> However, as she was the plaintiff in this case and bore the burden of proof, without any other examples or evidence before me, I could only assess her allegation based on this example. As I have explained above, I did not see how this was unreasonable of the Husband, nor how this made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     As a further example of how the Husband had controlled the Wife’s finances, the Wife stated that the Husband had refused to extend a loan of $6,000 to her mother and a loan of $50,000 to her father. This must be read against the background and context within which such requests were made. There was some confusion as to when these loans were requested, and in relation to the loan of $50,000, it was unclear whether it was the Wife’s mother who asked for the monies, the Wife’s father who asked for the monies, or whether it was the Wife’s father who asked through the Wife’s mother. However, it was not disputed that when this loan was requested, the parties did not know that it was because the Wife’s father had suffered a stroke.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> The parties only knew about the stroke sometime in 2019. Prior to the request for such loans, the parties had previously extended a loan of $6,000-$7,000 to the Wife’s brother. It was not disputed that the loan remains unpaid and the Husband had also never chased the Wife nor the Wife’s brother for the repayment of this sum.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Therefore, when a further loan of a much higher sum was sought, and with parties not knowing the reason behind such a request, it was not unreasonable for the Husband to have expressed reservations and concerns.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife also gave examples of how the Defendant controlled her spending by imposing certain limits on her credit cards and the amounts she could withdraw.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s evidence was that he had not expected her to ask for permission before spending the money.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> The Wife had also raised that she was restricted in her ability to make purchases according to her own preferences and timing. In my view, it was clear that the Husband did not in fact impose such limits nor restrictions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, the Wife did not provide any evidence to show that these limits were <em>imposed by the Husband</em>. On the stand, the Wife admitted that she had only recently found out that <em>the bank</em> actually sets default limits,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> and she had always believed that it was the Husband who had put in the limits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> As such, I found that she simply assumed and believed that it was the Husband who imposed these limits, from the mere fact of the existence of such limits. There was no evidence led to prove that the Husband had in fact lowered the default limit imposed by the banks.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, the Wife conceded that the Husband would pay the credit bills when the Wife needed to purchase an item after the credit card limit had been reached.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> In such cases, when the card was declined at the point of purchase, the Wife stated that she would “call him, and then he will increase”. By this, it cannot be said that the Husband imposed a limit as the Husband was prepared to simply pay up the outstanding credit card transaction charges so that the Wife could continue using the card <em>beyond</em> the limit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, the Wife did not try to change any of the default limits; in fact, it appeared that she never knew she could.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span> She also did not communicate to the Husband to do so, and her answer as to why she did not do so was simply that she was afraid and dared not do so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span> Picking up on this recurrent refrain of fear, I had asked the Wife to clarify why she had responded that she “dare not” do certain things.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> Having observed the Wife on the stand, I did not find her answer to be very convincing. She appeared to be tentative and hesitant in her response to my clarification, which was a stark contrast to how she conducted her response while under cross-examination by the Husband’s Counsel. I therefore found that there was no reason as to why she did not actually communicate this with the Husband and she was trying hard to put together some semblance of a reason in direct response to my question. In the circumstances, I agreed with the Husband’s submissions that the concerns raised by the Wife about her spending limits appeared to be an afterthought raised in the context of divorce proceedings, instead of being a real concern during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the round, I found that the Husband had not acted unreasonably in the way he conducted himself over the parties’ financial affairs. I found that the Husband not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged increasing exclusion of the Wife from the family business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As I have explained above, I found that the parties were content to organise themselves in a certain way, <em>i.e.</em>, the Husband will run the financial matters while the Wife will take care of the household. I found that this was also the case for the family business, if not even more so. The Wife had herself stated that she “trusted the [Husband] fully in the family finances and family businesses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> She also did not deny that the Husband “has experience in property business in terms of financial/numbers matters, with the [Husband] having invested in residential and commercial properties in Hong Kong”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Against this backdrop, the parties had always conducted themselves in a way where the Husband would be in charge of running the family business. In fact, it was not disputed that this was how things were since the start of the business. The Wife was “not privy to the financial standing of the companies from the beginning until most recently when she instructed her lawyers to purchase the financial statements available on ACRA bizfile”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> At first blush, the fact that the Wife was not privy to the financial standing of the companies from the beginning may appear to be unreasonable as it suggested that the Husband had deliberately sought to exclude the Wife from the family business. However, when one considered the context and history of how parties have conducted themselves from the start of the marriage, it would be immediately apparent that far from being unreasonable, this was in fact how parties had operated based on a mutual understanding. The Wife was content to leave all financial matters to the Husband because he was financially savvy, was an accountant by training, and had managed various investments. From the very beginning, the Husband had been running the family business without needing to consult the Wife on business decisions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span> Therefore, in a sense, the Wife had always been excluded from the financial matters in the family business but this was not because the Husband had unreasonably, nefariously nor maliciously sought to do so. On the contrary, this was how parties had decided to divide the labour between them: the Husband would focus on the family business, the Wife would leave the Husband to run the business while she focused on the family and did whatever was needed of her in the business. This was also consistent as to how the parties would manage their household finances, as I had found above. The Wife conceded she had no idea of the financials of the various companies she was a director of, that she simply signed whatever she was asked to sign, that she did not understand any of the commercial documents, and that she chose to trust and did in fact trust the Husband that he would do whatever was best for the company.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span> It was all the more telling, as the Husband puts it in the Husband’s Submissions, that when questioned about the family business, the Wife admitted that she only took issue with the Husband’s decisions in relation to the family business <em>after</em> she decided to divorce him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In my view, having assessed the parties’ evidence in their affidavits as well as having had the opportunity to observe their testimony on the stand, I found that there was a certain understanding between the parties that this was how they would operate vis-à-vis the family business, <em>i.e.</em>, that at the end of the day, it was for the Husband to decide how the business ought to be run, and what decisions ought to be made. The Wife had no issues with this arrangement, until such time she decided that she wanted to divorce the Husband. That was when she decided to take issue with how things had always been, and, in my view, retrospectively viewed the Husband’s conduct as unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As for the exclusion of the Wife with the introduction of the parties’ eldest daughter Amanda into the family business, it was the Wife’s own evidence on the stand that it could not be unreasonable for the Husband to pass the business down to Amanda, given that it was always the plan to pass the business down to her eventually.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> Therefore, involving Amanda in business decisions rather than the Wife did not appear to me to be unreasonable in any way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Further, the Wife stated that she had “contributed in other necessary aspects, for eg the advertising / marketing, design, or publishing of the properties”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> This was not disputed by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> The evidence of AKC showed that there were some discussions between the Wife and AKC. The evidence of CNH also showed that there was some involvement by the Wife in a certain project. At this point, I would pause to note that I found the evidence of CNH largely irrelevant. Having observed him on the stand, I found that CNH was clearly trying to downplay the Wife’s involvement and repeatedly reiterated that he only dealt with the Husband and not the Wife. Nonetheless, it was clear from the evidence that the Wife was involved in some aspects of the project, but this involvement was on a limited scale. All major decisions were still made by the Husband, which was in line with the parties’ arrangement as to the division of labour as I have outlined above. This point therefore did not assist the Wife very much.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     In the round, I found that the Husband had not acted unreasonably in the way he conducted himself over his treatment of the Wife in the family business. The way parties operated was in line with the tacit understanding they had about their respective roles. In any event, the Wife did not take issue with this only until she contemplated the divorce, at which time she then decided that the Husband’s conduct was retrospectively unreasonable. I therefore found that the Husband had not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged disregard and disrespect for the Wife in his conduct towards her</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Finally, I turn to the third broad category raised by the Wife regarding the Husband’s disregard and disrespect towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The first incident mentioned in the Wife’s Submissions was that at her grandmother’s funeral in August 2002, she had one of her feet caught in a pothole and the Husband did not extend his hand to help her out but instead shouted at her. In my view, this incident did not assist much. The Wife explained that she was carrying her then 2-year-old son Caleb, her feet was stuck, she could not see anything, all she could see was the wheel of the hearse moving towards her, and that the Husband was shouting at her to stand up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> The Wife conceded that she did not know the Husband was busy watching over the 2 older children and did not know what else he could be doing. First, the evidence and details of this event were rather sketchy as it was not clear what the Husband was doing. For example, if the Husband was just standing right next to the Wife and did not extend his hand to help, that could well have been unreasonable. However, if the Husband was a distance away and was in fact taking care of the other two children, then it may not have been unreasonable for him to react the way he did. In any case, without any evidence, it was not clear to me what actually happened. Even if I were to take the Wife’s evidence at face value, I did not think it was unreasonable, during a busy funeral procession where the Husband was managing the 2 other children, for the Husband to shout at the Wife to stand up and quickly get out of the way in view of the moving procession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     As for how the Husband did not treat her as a business partner, I have detailed my findings in the previous section regarding the parties’ arrangement vis-à-vis their financial matters and family business. As I mentioned earlier, it was my assessment that the Wife had been content to leave these decisions to the Husband. For her to now say she was upset about the Husband making these decisions without first consulting her, appears to me to be an afterthought to clothe the Husband’s behaviour with unreasonableness so as to bring them within the test in s. 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter. In addition, if the Wife had decided, abruptly in 2019 after so many years, that the Husband’s past conduct was unacceptable to her and that she found it unreasonable, it was incumbent on her to communicate this change in her preference to the Husband. If the Husband had continued acting just as how parties have ordered their affairs in line with their understanding all these years, he could not have known that the Wife now finds it unreasonable. Communication is a two-way street. I did not see how the Husband can be faulted for continuing to do what he has always done all these years without receiving any complaint from the Wife. The Husband had stated on the stand that had he known, he would be prepared to engage the Wife and have better communication. Having seen parties on the stand, I had no reasons to doubt the Husband. Now that the Husband is made aware of this preference, I can only hope and urge that parties find a way to communicate and interact moving forward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Before I leave this point on communication, the Wife had also mentioned that the Husband commented on her choice of friends and was unhappy with guests staying over at their matrimonial property. There were scant details given in the Wife’s P1 on how the Husband was unhappy and what transpired during these episodes. On the stand, the Wife also conceded that there was no evidence provided in support of this allegation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span> As such, with just a single bare assertion, it was not clear what these “comments” were and how the Husband was “unhappy” or what he did to express such unhappiness. I was therefore unable to make any meaningful finding as to what actually happened or whether the Husband has acted in a way that made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him. At this point, I would also reiterate that the Wife did not communicate her own unhappiness about the Husband’s conduct to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Lastly, I turn to the conduct of the Husband in relation to a certain café business. The parties were cross-examined extensively on this issue. It was not disputed that the Husband had initially funded the start of this café and that the Husband managed the finances.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span> Again, this was in line with my assessment that all major decisions, especially financial matters and in relation to the family business, were made by the Husband. While the Wife initially stated that the Husband had assured her that there was “no need to make money”, she eventually said that the Husband had told her that “any profit earned in later years may be used to offset the previous year’s losses”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The bottom-line was that there was no agreement to keep the café open at all cost, even if the café was making a loss. Unfortunately, this was exactly what happened as the café sustained millions in losses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> The Husband therefore made the decision to close the café. The Wife was upset that the Husband did not consult her in this decision and explained that as his wife, the Husband never discussed this with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span> However, this being a business decision, I did not see how it would be unreasonable for the Husband to make such a decision, given how parties have been conducting themselves in relation to the family business. The Wife also agreed that it was reasonable for the Husband to make the financial decision to stop funding the café business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Although the Wife was not aware of the financial health and status of the café, it was undisputed that she managed the operations of the café. It was for this reason that the Wife felt some attachment to the café.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span> In my view, her chief complaint about the closure of the café business was how it was communicated to her. The Wife felt that the decision was made and imposed on her without room for discussion, with the Husband simply telling her to close the café as he had found a tenant for the space.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> On this, the Wife first said that the Husband told her to close down the cafe in 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span> Thereafter, the parties then had another discussion in 2019 about the closure of the café. While the Wife may have been in “shock” in 2017,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> the topic of the closure of the café would no longer have been new in 2019. There was therefore sufficient time for the Wife to make the necessary arrangements for the closure, or to have further discussions with the Husband, had she intended to, given that the closure of the café was subsequently deferred for 2 years. In fact, the Wife pointed out some exchange of messages and discussions in 2019 regarding the discussions of the closure. The closure of the café was therefore not as sudden given that the writing would have been on the wall for some time by then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In March 2019, the Wife had a discussion with the Husband, wherein she had intended to ask the Husband for another 6 months to try running the café.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> The Wife stated that in that conversation, the Husband told her that she would make him bankrupt. The Husband’s account was that he did not tell her she would make him bankrupt, but that an ordinary person, who ran the café in this manner sustaining losses in the millions, would have been bankrupt.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> The Wife did not adduce any contemporaneous evidence of such a comment, given that this was a verbal discussion. On this, having observed the parties on the stand, I preferred the Husband’s version of events. I found that the Wife’s account of this episode tended to focus on the word “bankrupt” and while emotionally charged, I had doubts as to whether her interpretation and recall was accurate. I had no doubt that the word “bankrupt” was used, but I had reservations as to whether the words as uttered by the Husband was what the Wife had recounted. On the other hand, the Husband’s answers were clear and reasonable, which accorded with financial considerations given his role in managing the finances of the family business and cohered with the financial health situation of the business. That said, I considered that the Husband’s comment of how an ordinary person would have been bankrupt would have made the Wife upset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Whilst the Husband’s handling of the closure of the café business could have engaged the Wife more while using more neutral language, given that she had a major role in running the operations of the café, this was but one incident which I was able to point to in the entire course of marriage which the Wife was justifiably upset. The closure of the café was surely not a small decision, as it meant a lot to the Wife. However, bearing in mind that at the end of the day, this was a financial decision in relation to the family business, and given my finding that the parties were operating along an arrangement where the Husband made all the major decisions, I still found that the closure of the café could not be said to be an unreasonable decision. Perhaps the way the Husband handled this could have been better, but that does not mean that he had acted unreasonably. In a marriage, there are bound to be disagreements and differences where one party would be upset at the other. This is not unexpected but a party being upset does not mean that it would be grounds for a divorce. In any event, even if for the sake of argument that the Husband’s conduct on this closure was found to be unreasonable, I did not think that overall, having regard to the circumstances of the case and the test in <em>Wong Siew Boey</em>, this single episode in the entire course of marriage, given how parties have been living their lives, can be said to amount to behaviour which made it unreasonable to expect the Wife to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In the round, I therefore found that the Husband did not treat the Wife with disregard and disrespect which amounted to unreasonable behaviour. I found that the Husband had not behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to continue living with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Having found that the Wife did not prove that the Husband has behaved in such a way that the Wife cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Husband, I therefore dismissed the Wife’s claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband sought costs of $28,000 given that the trial took place over 5 days and an additional half-day was spent on submissions and arguments. Furthermore, the affidavits filed were voluminous and multiple witnesses were called. The SOP was fairly lengthy and spanned across 10 pages, so while the case eventually centred on 3 particular categories, time was still spent on canvassing each and every assertion made by the Wife. In support, the Husband relied on <em>WBA v WBB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27249-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 24</a> (“<b><em>WBA</em></b>”) for the proposition that for contested divorce trials, the range of $3,000 to $5,000 for the first day of trial was the norm. As this was a matter which spanned multiple days and in view of the voluminous evidence canvassed at trial, the Husband sought costs of $28,000. The Husband also relied on <em>VGT v VGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24332-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 32</a> wherein the Court fixed costs at $11,000 for a trial which lasted two full days and two half days, and costs should therefore be higher in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Wife argued that costs should be fixed at $12,000, as the costs for contested divorce hearings typically ranged from $2,000 to $12,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As costs follows the event, the Husband is entitled to costs as he has successfully defended against the Wife’s claim. After hearing the parties’ submissions, I fixed costs at $12,000 payable by the Wife to the Husband. Much of the morning on the first day of trial was spent giving parties time to negotiate and work out a settlement on amicable resolution. Therefore, the trial proper took place for only slightly more than half a day on Day 1. For Day 4 of the trial, the trial did not take the whole day and ended about halfway through the afternoon. Considering the length of the trial, the case of <em>WBA</em> did not assist the Husband very much. In that case, the Court eventually ordered costs of $10,000 (all-in), where the evidence was heard over 4.5 days of trial, and a further half day decision hearing. Therefore, in terms of trial duration, this was similar to <em>WBA</em> and costs would have been at a similar range and not as high as $28,000 as sought by the Husband. I have nonetheless ordered more than the $10,000 in <em>WBA</em> because the affidavits in this case were voluminous, as a result of the Wife’s lengthy pleadings going into events dating back to more than 20 years ago. I also noted that in terms of the number of witnesses, there were 3 additional witnesses called, although they did not take up much time and did not add very much to the length of the trial. The affidavits filed by the witnesses were also rather short and not much time were taken on the stand. In my view, a sum of $12,000 for costs was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In summary, I dismissed the Wife’s claim and fixed costs at $12,000.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>In this judgment, all the children’s names are pseudonyms.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Para 2 of the Statement of Particulars (<b>SOP</b>) and para 2.3 of the Defence.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Para 3.f of the SOP and para 2.5.1 of the Defence.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>This version referred to is that in force as of 20 December 2023.

Para 89 then goes on to reference a Singapore property in Lewis Road and explains that the Husband spent “matrimonial funds” without consulting her, and not funds from the family business. However, in my view, nothing turns on this distinction. I take the Wife to mean that the Husband has been excluding her from financial decisions whether in the business or in the marriage, which was apparent to be her case from the other evidence tendered.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Paras 36.c and 36.d of the Wife’s Submissions, paras 3.s and 3.t of the SOP, and paras 88-91 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Para 36.e of the Wife’s Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Para 38.a of the Wife’s Submissions, para 3.k of the SOP, and paras 72-73 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Para 38.c of the Wife’s Submissions, para 3.g of the SOP, and paras 63-64 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Para 38.f of the Wife’s Submissions, para 3.p of the SOP, and paras 84-85 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Para 38.g of the Wife’s Submissions, para 3.u of the SOP, and paras 92-95 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Para 38.b of the Wife’s Submissions, para 3.m of the SOP, and paras 79-83 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Paras 38.d and 38.e of the Wife’s Submissions, paras 3.j, 3.n and 3.o of the SOP, and paras 70-71 and 79-83 of P1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>Para 42 of the Wife’s Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Para 44 of the Wife’s Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>Para 47 of the Wife’s Submissions.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>This stood at 1,944 pages.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>Para 7 of the Husband’s Opening Statement.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_28_1\" id=\"Ftn_28\">[note: 28]</a></sup>Para 2.1 of the Defence.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_29_1\" id=\"Ftn_29\">[note: 29]</a></sup>Para 2.28 of the Defence.

The parties have 3 children to the marriage; all of them were adults when D 3951 was filed by the Wife. The grounds relied on by the Wife in obtaining divorce was that the parties had separated for more than 4 years prior to the filing of D 3951. The Husband himself acknowledges that he had effectively left the parties’ Singapore matrimonial home – <em>ie.</em> Blk [XX1] (“Matrimonial Flat”) – some eleven (11) years earlier as he was working predominantly in Malaysia, although he claims to have returned to Singapore on several occasions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       When D 3951 was commenced by the Wife, it was filed as simplified divorce proceeding given that <em>prima facie</em> both parties had executed all the necessary documents – including a draft copy of the IJ (“Draft IJ”)– setting out the agreed terms of the divorce on 26 August 2024. IJ was thus granted on an uncontested basis, with final judgment for divorce obtained not long thereafter on 13 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       For present purpose, the main term of the IJ which is central to the present applications is paragraph 3a. of the IJ, which states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“a. That the Defendant's rights, title and interest in the HDB matrimonial flat at Apt [Blk XX1] shall be transferred (other than by way of sale) to the Plaintiff within six (6) months of the date of grant of the Interim Judgment in full and final settlement of all her entitlements in ancillary matters. No CPF refunds are to be made to the Defendant's CPF account(s) for the purchase of the matrimonial flat in joint names. The Plaintiff is to bear the cost and expenses of the transfer.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife’s application, <em>vide.</em> FC/OADV 251/2025 (“OADV 251”), seeks an order <em>extending</em> the timeframe for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat as the six-month period under the aforesaid order has since expired.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband, on the other hand, filed FC/OADV 465/2025 (“OADV 465”) to set-aside completely the IJ (including paragraph 3a therein) on the basis that the Wife had committed fraud and/or had taken advantage of his poor health condition when obtaining his consent to the terms of the IJ back in August 2024. She then filed D 3951 without the Husband’s knowledge and had obtained the IJ improperly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In essence, the Husband claims that the terms of the IJ are unfair and would leave him “destitute”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> He says that he does not have a place to stay in Singapore and that a fair outcome would have been for the Matrimonial Flat to be sold and the proceeds therefrom divided between the parties.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For completeness, the Husband’s counsel acknowledged in his written submissions that if the Husband’s application is not granted, then the Husband <em>concedes</em> that he has no grounds to contest the Wife’s application to extend the time for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In light of the parties’ respective submissions in OADV 251 and OADV 465, the followings issues have to be determined by this Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Does the Court have the power to revoke (or set-aside) the IJ on account of the fraud perpetuated by the Wife or that she had taken advantage of the Husband’s poor health condition when the Draft IJ was executed?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Has the Husband satisfied the relevant legal requirements to justify revoking the IJ in its entirety?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If not, then whether the Wife’s application for an extension of time to complete the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat should be granted?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I will discuss each of these issues, in turn.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Basis For Revoking Or Varying Consent Orders </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The starting point of any discussion of the applicable legal principles relevant to the present application would be the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), given that the IJ was granted in a divorce application filed under Part 10 of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Section 112(4) of the WC specifically allows the court to “<em>extend, vary, revoke or discharge</em>” any orders made under s 112(1) of the WC (that is, the just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets consequent on their divorce). Section 112(4) would thus be the operative statutory provision under which this Court considers the parties’ application as this provision is juridical source of the Court’s power to change or revoke the terms of the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this regard, the Husband’s counsel had, in their oral and written submissions, referred to P. 1, r. 5(10) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. I am of the view that the scope and purpose of those provisions address an entirely <em>different</em> subject matter, <em>ie.</em> the Court’s overarching (and inherent) power to “<em>ensure justice is done or to prevent an abuse of the process of the Court</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> and would not be applicable to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     To the extent that the considerations overlap – for eg. whether there was any alleged fraud or misrepresentation in the Wife obtaining the IJ – such considerations would already have been taken into account in the context of s 112(4) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Returning to the ambit of s 112(4) of the WC, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0924.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 924</a> (“<em>AYM</em>”) explained that in considering whether to exercise the court’s power to vary or revoke an order, the court is concerned with whether the original order was unworkable, or has become unworkable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Additionally, where the court is faced with an application relating to a <em>consent</em> order, the Court of Appeal recognised fraud and the lack of full and frank disclosure as possible bases to vary or set-aside the said order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     What then about other vitiating factors which can be relied on to set-aside a consent order?

This is an intensely fact-sensitive enquiry which requires the party seeking to set-aside the order to show that: (i) he was suffering from an infirmity; (ii) such infirmity must have been, or ought to have been, evident to the other party procuring the transaction; (iii) that the other party exploited in procuring the transaction.

For context, counsel’s written submissions made vague references to the Wife’s conduct amounting to “<em>fraud and/or such other conduct that the IJ ought to be set-aside</em>”. What exactly is the alleged “<em>other conduct</em>”?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Counsel for the Husband confirmed that they are relying principally on the Wife’s alleged fraudulent misrepresentation as the main basis for the Husband’s application in OADV 465. Counsel also pointed out that the overall suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the Draft IJ and the one-sided nature of the IJ’s terms supported the Husband’s claim of fraud, as well as evidence of him being taken advantage of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As only these specific grounds for setting-aside are relied on by the Husband, I will focus only on these assertions. To be clear, I note that the allegation of his mental <em>incapacity</em> was also raised in the Husband’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> However, counsel acknowledged that a claim of mental incapacity is a <em>legally</em> different claim as compared to fraudulent misrepresentation, and that the Husband’s focus is on the latter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the Husband’s counsel’s confirmation, I will proceed to apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did the Wife commit “fraud” or did she take advantage of the Husband?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I start by addressing the allegation of fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     To begin with, the Court of Appeal in <em>AYM</em> had noted that “<em>standard of proof for fraud is a very high one and is, ex hypothesi, not easy to satisfy</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> In this regard, the Husband’s counsel accepts (and I agree) that what needs to be proven in the context of a fraud claim to set-aside the IJ is similar to that applicable for the tort of deceit (or more commonly referred to as tort of fraudulent misrepresentation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     As such, the burden fell on the Husband to show <em>inter alia</em> that (i) the Wife has made a false representation of fact; (ii) it was made with the intention of being acted upon by the Husband; (iii) the Husband did act upon the false statement; and (iv) that the Wife made the fraudulent representation knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly (in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true): see <em>Chan Pik Sun v Wan Hoe Keet (alias Wen Haojie)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32098-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 893</a> at [66] – [67] on the elements applicable to a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, the Husband has not met any of these legal requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To being with, the Husband did not clearly identify – whether in his affidavit or his counsel’s submissions – <em>what</em> was the specific false statement or representation of fact which the Wife had made to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In his counsel’s written submissions, the Husband made passing reference to the fact that the Wife had allegedly told him (<em>ie.</em> an oral, as opposed to written, representation) that obtaining a divorce would increase his chances in obtaining government subsidies. Yet, these assertions were made with reference to certain paragraphs contained in the <em>Wife’s</em> affidavits filed in these proceedings and not to the actual words supposedly uttered by the Wife on 8 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In fact, in the Husband’s initial reply affidavit to the Wife’s application in OADV 251 (“First Affidavit”), he made no reference to any specific representations made by the Wife at all. Instead, he made a <em>generalised</em> averment that he was not aware of what he had signed on a different date, <em>ie.</em> 26 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As I had noted above, not being aware of what he had signed is a substantively <em>different</em> averment than a fraudulent oral representation by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Upon clarification with counsel, it would appear that the Husband’s case is that he had simply trusted the Wife and the family who had asked him to sign documents (without any specific reference as to what it had contained). To me, that is not a sufficiently particularised allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     In any event, I find the Husband’s overall evidence to be wanting and, in many respects, contradictory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As I had alluded to above, the Husband made no mention of any discussions with the Wife on 8 August 2024 in his First Affidavit (filed in May 2025), choosing instead to only mention what had allegedly occurred on 26 August 2024, including the fact that his daughter and the Wife had asked “two women” (one of whom was a “lawyer”) to meet him at the hospital where he was staying to sign certain documents.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It was only <em>after</em> the Wife had filed another affidavit in July 2025 that the Husband claims, in a subsequent affidavit filed for OADV 465 (“Second Affidavit”), that he recalls certain conversations he had with the Wife on 8 August 2024 regarding the topic of divorce, and how getting a divorce may improve his eligibility for government subsidies. He says he was clear that he did not agree to any divorce or the terms thereof. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In other words, the Husband now <em>positively avers</em> that: (i) there was indeed a discussion about divorce with the Wife prior to him signing the Draft IJ (and other documents); (ii) he knew and could recall what had happened; and (iii) he had affirmatively <em>denied</em> her request for a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     To begin with, the Husband position in his Second affidavit stands in stark contrast to his First Affidavit, where he unequivocally stated that “<em>throughout all these years, we carried on in the marriage and </em><b><em>we had never spoken </em></b><em>about parting. In any case, we were both getting on in years and the marriage situation had not changed for</em> [emphasis added]”. His assertion that they “never spoke about parting” is, by his latest confirmation, evidently untrue since he now accepts that there were communications between the two parties on 8 August 2024 about divorce (several weeks prior to him signing the IJ).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Be that as it may, if what the Husband had deposed to in his Second Affidavit was true, it would have been clear to him that when he was asked to sign documents on 26 August 2024, in the presence of a “lawyer”, that this formal event must have been related to matters of a serious <em>legal</em> nature and significance, especially since the idea of divorce had been broached by the Wife a few weeks earlier. It could not be, as he had claimed in the First Affidavit, that the documents were merely meant to “<em>help</em> [him] <em>with finances and the costs associated with</em> [his] <em>hospital stay</em>”. No evidence was given as to why he would have thought that there would be a need for such documents to be signed in the presence of a lawyer if it was only for the costs of a hospital stay?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In gist, the overall tenor of the Husband’s case – as contained in the affidavits he had filed – was that he was completely clueless as to why he had signed documents on 26 August 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> He even asserted that he “<em>did not have the mental capacity nor was</em> [he] <em>capable of understanding the contents of the documents</em>”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> a point which he is no longer pursuing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It follows that much turns on whether the Husband was indeed as physically or mentally infirmed and/or incapacitated (as he claims to be) on 26 August 2024 such that the Court should accept his assertion that he was completely unaware of what was going on that day, despite what he now recalls had happened a few weeks earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It is on this matter which the evidence provided by Ms [C], the Commissioner for Oaths who attended at the Husband’s hospital on 26 August 2024, took on especial significance. Ms [C]’s narration of what had taken place that day was set out in her letter dated 19 May 2025 sent on the letterhead of her firm, [XX2] (“CFO Letter”). This letter was exhibited in the Husband’s Supplementary Affidavit filed on 10 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     At the outset, I accept Ms [C]’s position that as an independent Commissioner for Oaths, she owed no duty to either parties and that the contents of her letter provided a clear and detailed factual account of what had transpired on 26 August 2024. I also have no reason to doubt Ms [C]’s recollection of the relevant events which she explained left her with a deep impression given that it was her first time carrying out a commissioning appointment at a hospital.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> Neither the Husband nor his counsel could point to any factual or legal basis for me to doubt Ms [C]’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In the CFO Letter, Ms [C] – in no uncertain terms – explained that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     she disagreed with the Husband’s claim that he was “very ill” or that he could not understand what was happening;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Husband was “<em>alert, sitting up in bed</em>” when she met him</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     she checked with the Husband whether he could speak, read and understand the English language. The Husband replied her <em>in English</em> that he could, and then all subsequent interaction between them was conducted in English;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_d\"></a>(d)     she had <em>told</em> the Husband that she understood that the Wife and him had agreed to an uncontested divorce and she was here to witness his signature, to which the Husband answered in the affirmative;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_e\"></a>(e)     she told the Husband that he could “<em>seek independent legal advice</em>” and the Husband said it was not necessary as he was aware of what he was signing; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_f\"></a>(f)     he then read the Draft IJ twice and expressed his readiness to proceed to execute the documents by affixing his thumb print. He did so without assistance, and willingly. Ms [C] then affixed her Commissioner for Oath seal to the document, and signed it as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Ms [C]’s evidence puts to rest <em>any</em> claim by the Husband that he had been labouring under any mental incapacity or infirmity, had been unaware of what he was signing, or that he did not know that he had agreed to an uncontested divorce with the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I therefore find that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation made by the Wife to the Husband on 26 August 2024, or any other date. The Husband was neither unaware nor was he mislead by the Wife as to the contents of the Draft IJ when he executed the said documents on 26 August 2024. I find him to be fully aware of what he had executed that day. His belated attempt to set-aside the IJ via OADV 465 is, in my view, an attempt to renege on what he now believes to be a “bad bargain”, and not because he had been lied to by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     For the same reasons – including but not limited to Ms [C]’s evidence – I find that the Wife had not taken advantage of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     He was fully aware of the terms of the Draft IJ, had been extended an opportunity to take independent legal advice (even being reminded of this right in the presence of an independent Commissioner for Oaths) but chose not to do so as he was satisfied with the terms contained therein.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Indeed, I find the Husband’s case on this matter wanting in one important aspect – why would the Wife, having allegedly planned to take advantage of the Husband for some time and having laid out a detailed scheme to take over the Matrimonial Flat and leave the Husband destitute, take the risk of appointing an independent Commissioner for Oaths to attend at the hospital, allow her to verify the Husband’s understanding of the terms, and explain to him his right to counsel to the Husband (and thus take apart her furtive plans)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Further, as the Wife’s counsel had pointed out – armed with an allegedly unfair IJ and an improperly obtained Power of Attorney granting their daughter the right to act in place of the Husband, why did the Wife not proceed to unilaterally carry out the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat to consummate her nefarious plan? Instead, she took the unnecessary step of contacting the Husband to carry out the property transfer through the usual means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Wife’s actions run counter to someone who is trying to take advantage of the Husband’s vulnerabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     For completeness, in reaching the above conclusions, I make the following additional observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</b>. The Husband’s claim for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation also fails because <em>inter alia</em> he has not clearly pointed to the allegedly false representation which the Wife had made to him which induced him to sign the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I did not take into account the parties’ 8 August 2024 conversations since neither the Husband, nor his counsel relied on the events of this date. In any event, what was discussed could at best be statement as to the Wife’s <em>belief</em> that a divorce may improve the chances of obtaining financial subsidies (even if it was indeed made) and not a statement of fact, nor has the Husband shown that the Wife had no genuine belief as to its truth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Insofar as the Husband is relying on something spoken or said on 26 August 2024, he has adduced no objective evidence to support his case. Given Ms [C]’s evidence, the Husband simply has not passed the high threshold required to support a finding of fraud.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <b>Unconscionability / Unfair Advantage</b>. Insofar as any claim of unconscionability (or unfair advantage) is concerned, a critical element of this claim is proof that the Wife <em>was aware</em> of the Husband’s incapacity or infirmity, and she had then <em>taken advantage of, or exploited</em> the same. The mere presence of a mental infirmity on the Husband alone would not suffice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In my view, I find that the Husband would have failed in his claim <em>regardless</em> of whether he was indeed infirmed at the material time. This is because the Wife had arranged for an independent Commissioner for Oaths to facilitate and assist with the execution of the IJ, and the IJ was not signed in her or their daughter’s presence. Ms [C] had explained that the Husband was given ample opportunity to consider the terms of the IJ, and had been told of his right to seek legal advice. He then executed the IJ having expressed his understanding of its terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Under these circumstances, there was no reason for the Wife to know (or even suspect) that the Husband was labouring under any infirmity or incapacity which affected his ability to provide his consent to the terms of the IJ on 26 August 2024. As such, the Wife could not be said to have taken advantage of any infirmity or incapacity suffered by the Husband, which she had been aware of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Husband’s alleged medical condition</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Although my findings above are sufficient to dispose of OADV 465, I will, for completeness, set out my views on the Husband’s alleged incapacity or mental infirmity because of his medical condition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In my view, having considered the evidence produced by the Husband, I find that he has not proven that had been suffering from <em>any</em> mental incapacity or infirmity on 26 August 2024 which affected his ability to understand, comprehend and thereafter provide his consent (and assent) to the terms of the IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As I had outlined above, the detailed narration provided by Ms [C] strongly supports (and corroborates) the Wife’s description of the Husband’s physical condition and mental acuity on 26 August 2024 (set out in her affidavit filed in relation to OADV 465,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> and in her reply affidavit for OADV 251).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As against the Wife’s and Ms [C]’s evidence, the Husband principally relies on his bare recollection (as contained in his affidavits) and a medical report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital dated 28 March 2025 (“TTSH Report”). authored by one Dr [DT] (a senior resident at the Department of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As alluded to above, I placed little weight on the Husband’s alleged recollection in his affidavits which, in my view, was not entirely consistent or clear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     With respect to the TTSH Report, I am of the view that the Husband has placed undue reliance on what appears to be a <em>general</em> medical report of his hospital stay and medical history. The TTSH Report is not an <em>expert</em> report from a psychiatric or mental health expert witness giving his or her assessment or opinion of the Husband’s mental capacity or acuity on 26 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Indeed, the TTSH Report itself does not indicate any mental capacity assessment was done on the Husband on 26 August 2024, or even within the same month. Even on the Husband’s own case, he submits that an assessment was done by an occupational therapist <em>after</em> his admission to the hospital on 11 September 2024 where he was noted to have “cognitive impairment”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Even if that was true, this would have been <em>after</em> the Draft IJ had been executed. It would be an inferential leap for the Court – in the absence of clear and credible expert evidence – to assume that the Husband had been suffering the same “cognitive impairment” one month earlier. I do not agree with counsel that there is basis to suspect what the Husband’s condition was weeks earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     What is more important, however, is that the Court should not make assumptions as to what “<em>cognitive impairment</em>” may mean in relation to the Husband, and how it may have affected him on 26 August 2024. The thrust of the Husband’s case appears to be that simply because when he was screened under the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test, he had been given a particular score associated with cognitive impairment, it follows <em>ipso facto</em> that he had no capacity (or at the least, no mental ability) to understand to the Draft IJ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     With respect, that is an assumption which cannot be made in the absence of proper expert evidence. I also do not agree with the Husband’s counsel that this is a matter which the Court can simply take “judicial notice” of. Judicial notice can only be resorted to when the issue in question falls within one of the recognised categories in s 59 of the Evidence Act 1893, or if relates to a matter which is of clear notoriety, or which is capable of being immediately and accurate shown to exist by authoritative sources.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> The effect of the alleged “cognitive impairment” suffered by the Husband does not fall under any of these categories. In my view, it can only be answered by a person skilled in the relevant science.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Overall, I find that the Husband has not discharged his burden to demonstrate that he was labouring under any mental infirmity or incapacity at the material time such that he was unable to understand what was contained in the IJ, or to give his consent to the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     It follows therefore that he has not shown how the Wife had taken advantage of, or had misled, him to execute the IJ. That being the case, there is no need for the Court to consider whether the terms of the IJ reflected a just and equitable division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     As Choo Han Teck J had held in <em>Lee Min Jai</em> (some twenty years ago) and more recently, in <em>WWQ v WWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32765-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 3</a>, “[a] <em>court will not lightly vary the terms of a settlement agreement simply because in the court’s view such revision would lead to a more equitable result. The court has to respect the fact that the parties would have had their own private reasons for agreeing to the settlement</em>…”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s application should be allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In light of my decision set out above, the final question I have to consider is whether to <em>vary</em> paragraph 3a. of the IJ in the manner sought by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     To recapitulate, the Wife had filed OADV 251 seeking an extension of time for the transfer of the Matrimonial Flat as the original timeframe for the same had expired in April 2025 (<em>ie.</em> 6 months after the IJ was granted). As noted earlier, the Husband accepts that if his application was not granted, there is no basis for him to contest OADV 251.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I agree with the Wife that a further extension of time ought to be granted. In my view, the original timeframe had lapsed due to the Husband’s refusal (perhaps due to his belief that the IJ was not properly obtained, an argument which I have rejected) and the original terms of the IJ have become unworkable as a result.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I will therefore grant the extension of time sought by the Wife as this variation would enable the original intention of the IJ , <em>viz.</em> the transfer of the Husband’s rights and interests in the Matrimonial Flat to the Wife, would be implemented.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     In conclusion, I grant an Order-in-terms of Prayers 1 to 3 of OADV 251, and dismiss OADV 465 in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     I will hear the parties on the issue of costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit dd 10.07.25 filed for OADV 465 (“RA2”) at [8]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup><em>Ibid</em> at [9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Husband’s Written Submissions dd 26.09.25 (“RS”) at [40]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>A similar set of powers is set out in the Rules of Court 2021 in relation to civil proceedings.

The Son alleged that the Father had inflicted family violence on him. He thus filed the present application, in SSP 1220/2025 (“SSP 1220”), for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against his Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of this matter, as well as oral submissions from both Father and Son on 26 September 2025. This is my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The law, as is contained in the family violence provisions found in the Women’s Charter 1961, makes it clear that the Son must, in order to obtain a PPO, establish the following two elements on a balance of probabilities: Section 60A of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The first, is that the Father had committed family violence on him, or that the Father was likely to do so. The second, is that it is necessary for the court to order a PPO for his personal safety or protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Son had, in his complaint form, cited numerous incidents of family violence that the Father had allegedly committed. These incidents arose because the Father did not approve of his Son’s living habits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       For example, the Son complained of a scuffle with the Father on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2025. The Son says that the Father had tried to close his bedroom door. The Son resisted. In this scuffle, the Son had tried to use his foot to prevent the Father from closing the door. The Father had allegedly tried to use a lighter to burn his foot. The Father had also stomped on his foot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       In his testimony, the Father admitted to stomping on his Son’s foot. The Father also admitted to using a lighter to try to scare the Son, though he says that the lighter was never lit, nor did he burn his Son’s foot in the incident.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The second example was this incident which had taken place on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2024. There was an argument over the Son using a wall socket to charge his laptop. The Son alleges that, in the ensuing quarrel, the Father had scolded him, slapped his left cheek, shoved his head backwards and pulled his hair. The Son also says the Father had spit on him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In his testimony, the Father admitted to slapping his Son, pushing him, pulling his hair, grabbing his phone and spitting on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The third example was an incident which had taken place on 26 August 2024. The Son had fallen asleep on the sofa in the living room. The Father had, upon discovering the Son fast asleep on the sofa, poured water over him. The day before this incident, the Father had also discovered the Son asleep on the sofa. In an attempt to wake the Son, the Father shot him in the face with a rubber band.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In his testimony, the Father candidly admitted to what he had done. He said he had poured water on the Son. He also said he had used a rubber band to hit him. His reason was that if his Son wanted to sleep, then he should have gone to sleep in his own bedroom.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I find that the Father had, in these three incidents cited above, committed family violence on the Son. His acts of threatening to burn his Son’s foot with a lighter, slapping him, and pulling his hair, all fall within the definition of physical abuse (see Section 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961). While the Father alluded to disciplining his Son as justification for his acts, he cannot avail himself of the “correction exception” set out in s 58B(2)(c)(ii) of the Women’s Charter 1961. That is because the Son is above 18 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this connection, I also find that it is necessary to order the PPO for the Son’s personal safety or protection. These incidents had arisen because the Son continued to live in the same flat as the Father. It appears that this living arrangement would continue for the foreseeable future – the Son testified that he would continue to live in the same flat, until he had the resources to move out on his own.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Then there is also the Father’s method of expressing his disapproval of his Son’s living habits. I had asked the Father if he had realised that his manner of communicating with his son might not be productive. The Father had told me that he had tried to tell his Son nicely, but his words fell on deaf ears, and the Son stubbornly refused to change his behaviour. The Father also told me that if the Son continued to behave in this way, he would not be able to tolerate it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The inference I draw from this is that the Father is becoming increasingly frustrated and irritated with his Son’s living habits. Further, and on the Father’s own evidence, it appears to me that when the Father realised that his words had no effect on his Son, he resorted to physical violence, thinking that this would cause the Son to change his behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I thus conclude that a PPO should be granted in the Son’s favour. This PPO, however, shall be limited for a period of three years: Section 60A(3)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. It is clear that the conflict between Father and Son had arisen because both share a common space. That being said, the Son had spoken of his intention to move out and find his own accommodation once he had graduated and found a job. In this vein, the Son had given evidence that he was likely to find gainful employment when he graduated in two years’ time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Given this, I deemed it appropriate to limit the validity of the PPO for the aforementioned period (meaning that the PPO shall be valid till the 21<sup>st</sup> of October 2028).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As a final point, it was not lost on me that despite their quarrels and hostility towards each other, both the Father and the Son, deep down, longed for the love, acknowledgement and affection of the other. During the course of their respective testimonies, the both of them did express, with a tinge of sadness, that the other had never truly acknowledged their relationship as father and son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> I am therefore ordering that both the Father and Son go for counselling, in the hopes that they would learn how to better manage their conflict, and in time, rebuild the father-son relationship.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Transcript at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Transcript at p 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Transcript at p 33.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Transcript at p 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Transcript at p 36.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Transcript at pp 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Transcript at p 7, 21, 30.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family violence – PPO – Necessity"],"date":"2025-10-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS No 2093 of 2024","title":"XSG v XSF","citation":"[2025] SGFC 104","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33998-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant in person","Mr Nicholas Leow Zhi Wei & Ms Eunice Ong Ying Ting (Netto & Magin LLC) for the Respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-10-31T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Tan Shin Yi","html":"<root><head><title>XSG v XSF</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSG <em>v</em> XSF </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33998-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 104</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS No 2093 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">02 October 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Tan Shin Yi </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Applicant in person; Mr Nicholas Leow Zhi Wei &amp; Ms Eunice Ong Ying Ting (Netto &amp; Magin LLC) for the Respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XSG — XSF </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family violence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">PPO</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Necessity</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">2 October 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Tan Shin Yi:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       In this case, the wife applied for a personal protection order (“PPO”) and a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) against the husband in November 2024. Both parties are also engaged in acrimonious child-related and divorce proceedings in both Singapore and Malaysia, after the breakdown of the marriage sometime in 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the parties on 20 February 2025 and 11 March 2025. On 25 March 2025, I granted a PPO for the wife and dismissed the application for a DEO. The husband has since appealed against my decision and these are the reasons for my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties were originally Malaysian citizens and married in May 2014. They have three children, M, S and O, aged 9, 7 and 3 years respectively. The family resided in Malaysia then moved to Australia for about a year from 2023 to May 2024. Thereafter, they returned to Malaysia and lived in a house with the husband’s family members until sometime in September 2024, when the wife and the children moved out. Both parties are currently Singapore citizens and own a flat in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Subsequently, in November 2024, the wife and two elder children, M and S, moved to Singapore while the husband remained in Malaysia with O. The circumstances surrounding the wife’s move to Singapore with the elder children and the husband’s <em>de facto</em> care of O are disputed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The wife alleged that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> since mid-2024, the husband had repeatedly pressured her to sell their flat in Singapore and when she refused, he stopped paying for the family’s expenses, harassed her and told her to leave the family home. After a quarrel late at night on 13 June 2024, the wife claimed that the husband kept insisting that she leave the house. The wife packed her things and moved to her parents’ home with the children temporarily on 14 June 2024. The wife eventually moved out of the matrimonial home on 29 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The incidents of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The wife relied on the following incidents in support of her application<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_i\"></a> <b>(i)</b> On 14 December 2019, the husband punched the wife in the face, threw the wife’s phone on the floor and then attempted to pull/drag her into the swimming pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_ii\"></a> <b>(ii)</b> On 14 June 2024, the husband went to the home of the wife’s parents, where the wife and children were, and there was a scuffle.

Subsequently, during cross-examination, the husband admitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> he was “very angry” and “smashed the phone on the floor”. In response to a photograph showing an injury in the wife’s eye, the husband claimed that when the phone was smashed, the glass shards “flew out” and landed in the wife’s eye.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 14 June 2024, the husband claimed that he came home and discovered the wife and children missing from the home, as well as the children’s passports. His father informed him that the wife and children were at her parents’ home and he went there to “get the children’s passports back”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The husband did not deny that he pressed the doorbells of the neighbours’ homes but claimed that this was to seek their “assistance in phoning the police” and he claimed he only honked his car horn once to get the wife’s parents to open the door.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The husband did not deny that on 14 June 2024, there was a physical scuffle between the parties. However, he claimed in a police report lodged on 15 June 2024, that the wife was the aggressor and that she had pulled his shirt, scratched him and slapped his left cheek. He also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> the wife was the one who had “caused hurt” to him on 14 June 2024 and he had suffered injury; and the wife was “locked up” for one night.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 6 July 2024, the husband denied that the incident occurred as he was not at home between 12.30pm to 3.30pm.

During cross-examination, he denied<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> blocking the wife’s car and preventing her from leaving the home. However, after being shown the CCTV recording, he then claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> the car belonged to him, not to the wife and that he wanted to drive it for servicing<b>.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The husband did not deny that on 19 October 2024, he did not allow the wife to take O with her or that he threatened not to return her belongings unless she left O with him.

He claimed that he did so as he was “angry and anxious”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> and wanted to prevent her from settling down in Singapore. During cross-examination<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, however, he denied doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Amendments to the family violence provisions in the Women’s Charter 1961 came into force on 2 January 2025. However, as the present application was filed in November 2024, the pre-amendment provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 apply, namely the former sections 64 and 65.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It is trite law that pursuant to s 65(1) of the pre-amendment Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”), the court may grant a PPO only if the following conditions are fulfilled:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Family violence must be committed or is likely to be committed; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The PPO is necessary for the protection of the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The above conditions must be proven by the applicant on a balance of probabilities, and not on the higher criminal standard of proof of “beyond reasonable doubt”. Pursuant to s 64 of the Charter, “family violence” was defined as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against their will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     With regard to the limb of “continual harassment” in the Charter, the High Court in <em>UNQ v. UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> whether the person possessed the necessary intention or knowledge at the time would be inferred from <em>all</em> the circumstances of the case, and the court may infer such intention or knowledge “<em>based on the state of the parties’ relationship at the time, or evidence of the communications between the parties at the relevant period</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In <em>Yue Tock Him @ Yee Chok Him v. Yee Ee Lim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGDC 0099.xml')\">[2011] SGDC 99</a>, “harassment” is taken to mean a course of conduct by a person which is “<em>sufficiently repetitive in nature as would cause, and which he ought reasonably to know would cause, worry, emotional distress or annoyance to another person”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     On the issue of whether a PPO is necessary, some of the relevant considerations<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> are whether there is a real risk of future family violence, whether the parties are likely to have future interactions with each other and whether the past family violence was a one-off/recent occurrence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 14 December 2019</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The wife had tendered undated photographs of her injuries, a dated social media post showing the same/similar photographs and a police report. The wife’s mother also gave evidence in support of this incident. While there were some inconsistencies in the wife’s and her mother’s evidence regarding certain details of the incident, I accepted that there would be reasonably be some gaps in memory due to the length of time since the incident more than 5 years ago.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The husband admitted that he was angry with the wife on that day due to her alleged clubbing, and he also admitted that he had “smashed” the wife’s mobile phone on the phone and pulled her hands, at the very least. The husband also claimed that the wife was not injured by that incident, as he relied on the First Information Report lodged by the condominium security guard, which stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> “This resident her husband abusing her. She is seated at the guard post. She is not injured<em>.</em>” However, he did admit subsequently under cross-examination that the wife had suffered some injury to her eye. Based on the evidence, I was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, the husband had caused hurt to the wife by his acts which are known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 14 June 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Unfortunately, the video recording of the 14 June 2024 incident<b><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></b> did not capture the scuffle between the parties. The transcripts of the audio recordings tendered showed that the parties were arguing over the children and their passports. It was also undisputed that the parties had a physical scuffle, although their versions of what occurred and who was the aggressor differed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Given the husband’s admission that he had gone to the wife’s parents’ home to get the children’s passports back, and that he had honked the car horn and rang the doorbells of the house and the neighbours’ houses, he was likely in an agitated or angry state of mind at the time. The wife had also tendered evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> of her parents’ broken/damaged doorbell. I found no reason to disbelieve the wife’s evidence that the husband had pushed and grabbed her, or pulled her towards the ground, causing her to fall. The wife had also readily admitted that she had slapped the husband in self-defence. While the husband made an issue of this and claimed that the wife had caused hurt to him instead of the other way round, he did not file an application for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In the circumstances, I was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, the husband had caused hurt to the wife by his acts which ought to have been known would result in hurt, and that he had also wilfully or knowingly placed the wife in fear of hurt through such acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 6 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The husband denied that he was at home at the time of the incident and adduced a WhatsApp message conversation with a friend, purportedly showing that he was not at home between 12.30pm to 3.30pm that day. The wife tendered evidence of a receipt dated 7 July 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> showing that she had replaced her mobile phone screen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     There was no evidence to show why the wife would want to lie and falsely accuse the husband of having pushed her out of the room and thrown her mobile phone downstairs. If the wife had wanted to fabricate facts, I found it difficult to believe that she would not have come up with more serious allegations of violence. In any event, the husband’s bare denial that he was not at home and “alibi” were not conclusive evidence that the incident did not occur as he only accounted for his whereabouts for three hours in the afternoon and not for the whole day. The incident could have occurred either before or after the husband went to meet his friends. As such, I was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, the husband had committed acts that wilfully or knowingly placed the wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 19 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     It is undisputed that on 19 September 2024, the husband pushed the wife off the bed, although the circumstances are disputed. Again, there was no evidence to show that the wife had lied about this and if she wanted to lie, she could have made up more serious allegations of violence. I also found it hard to believe the husband’s evidence that the wife was the one who had sat on top of him to demand money and that he had pushed her off him because he could not breathe. As such, I was satisfied that on a balance of probabilities, the husband had caused hurt to the wife by his acts which are known or ought to have been known would result in hurt on this occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 3 October 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The CCTV recording of 3 October 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> showed the husband driving his car and parking it right in front of the wife’s car so that her car would not be able to move towards the gate without hitting his car. The wife was not in the car at the time. Based on the recording, the husband also took some items out of the car and threw them into his car. The husband changed his story on this incident several times. At first, he did not deny that he had blocked the wife’s car to stop her from leaving the house but claimed that this was “irrelevant” to the wife’s application. Subsequently, during cross-examination, he denied that he had done so until he was shown the CCTV recording. He then claimed that the car belonged to him, not the wife, and that he wanted to drive it for servicing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Based on the evidence and circumstances, I found that the husband had indeed blocked the wife’s car and taken her belongings in order to prevent her from leaving the matrimonial home. The husband’s acts amounted to wrongfully confining the wife against her will or wilfully or knowingly placing her in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incidents of continual harassment and threats from September to November 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The wife claimed that the husband had continually harassed her to sell their Singapore flat, cut off financial support to her and the children and kept the children’s passports, and told her to leave their matrimonial home, in order to pressure her to sell the flat. The wife’s claims also included that the husband used the children, especially O, to threaten and pressure her into agreeing to sell the Singapore flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     On 1 October 2024, the husband took O out of preschool and withdrew her from school the next day. The husband also informed the school that “[O] will need take long leave.. I bring her go oversea”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The text messages exchanged between the parties showed that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_i\"></a>(i)     The husband had asked the wife if she had decided not to sell the Singapore flat. When the wife replied “I’m currently busy with my career, I just need your encouragement”, the husband responded “we divorce. I will do the filing in the afternoon.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     The husband got M to inform the wife: “Can send school fee payment receipt… pls… or dad won’t let us go with you.. tell your mum”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     The husband informed the wife that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> “I will bring Penelope flight to Hong Kong tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. 225k I spend for the furniture and renovation 30k Total 255k”; and “I will request divorce then auction the HDB. This is my bottom line. Go back to Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     The husband told the wife “you move back to your mother’s place, and bring the children back every Sunday”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_v\"></a>(v)     The husband sent the wife a message<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span>: “I might migrate to Hong Kong very soon. I will ask my friend take care Penelope. I want to collect all Penelope’s [s]tuff”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     When the wife asked the husband if he had “plan this all” for O, “I don’t understand”, the husband responded “I would ask on Instagram, just say that her mother is gone, many people will volunteer to take care [O]”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_vii\"></a>(vii)     The husband told the wife “Do not bring [M] and [S] to oversea within 3 months. You choose to ignore me. I blocked the passport, if you don’t believe it, give it a try”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     It was not disputed that on 19 October 2024, the husband prevented the wife from taking O with her and threatened not to return her belongings unless she left O with him. The wife adduced a CCTV video recording of this incident in her evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>, without audio, which was not challenged by the husband. The video showed the wife’s car parked in the house driveway in front of the main door with both front doors open. At about 11.23am, the wife came out of the house, carrying O and got into the driver’s seat with O on her lap. After she closed the door on the driver’s side, the husband came out of the house and started taking things out of the car from the passenger’s side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The husband then opened the door of the driver’s side and parties appeared to be talking heatedly. The husband reached into the car and pulled at the wife’s arm, while O was seated on the wife’s lap. The husband handed some things to the wife, then moved to the passenger side, took some things out of the car and back to the driver’s side. An unknown male adult came out of the front door and stood at the open passenger door while the husband carried O and brought her into the house.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The husband did not deny that in November 2024, he had logged into the wife’s personal email account without her consent, and sent emails to her potential employers with parties’ police reports and proceedings, to prevent the wife from getting any job offers. In the emails sent by the husband to the wife’s potential employers, he informed them that the wife “has a record in the Malaysian police database showing a history of imprisonment due to assault”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and attached a copy of the police report he had lodged against the wife in June 2024. In the circumstances, I find that by his acts above, the husband had engaged in conduct that caused continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Necessity for PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Based on all the above incidents, I find that the husband has committed family violence against the wife. I would add that I did not place much weight on the December 2019 incident, compared to the 2024 incidents, because the 2019 incident occurred more than 5 years ago, and I accepted that the parties reconciled after this and went on to have their youngest child, O. Given the acrimony between the parties and the very contentious child custody proceedings, I also find that if unchecked, the husband is likely to commit family violence against the wife. I now consider whether a PPO and DEO are necessary for the wife’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The husband claimed that the wife had a “history of concocting and fabricating stories”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> against him. He also submitted that a PPO is not necessary as the wife has already moved out of the matrimonial home with M and S, and parties “hardly communicate save for matters relating to the children”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The husband’s allegation that the wife was prone to making up “stories” or allegations against him was not borne out by the various video and audio recordings, and messages between the parties, which supported the wife’s version of events. Most of the incidents cited were also not disputed by the husband, save that he claimed that he had his reasons for behaving the way he did.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     During the trial, the wife gave evidence in a straightforward manner and was a truthful witness. On the other hand, the husband’s demeanour during the trial was defensive and showed that he did not think that he had done anything wrong. When he was asked about blocking the wife’s car to prevent her from leaving the home, he denied this and when shown the video recording of the same, he then claimed that it was “not possible” for him to block her car as “the porch area is very large”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It is not disputed that both parties are now living separately and in view of the pending divorce proceedings, it is unlikely that they will cohabit again. However, parties currently have split care and control of the children in that the two elder children are residing with the wife and the youngest child is with the husband. Care and control is obviously very contested and access is also an issue between the parties. The children are also quite young, and in the circumstances, the parties will continue to have regular interactions for access and hand-over. Since the breakdown of the marriage in 2024, there has been an observable <em>pattern</em> of coercive and harassing behaviour by the husband towards the wife and in the circumstances, a PPO is necessary for the protection of the wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     However, I was not satisfied that there was a need for a DEO in this case, given that it was not disputed that the husband had not been to parties’ Singapore flat in at least two years.

They are largely non-verbal and need help with daily living. The offspring of the mother, (“M”), a South African national and the Father, (“F”), a French national working in Singapore since 2015, the twins presently reside in France with the M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In 2018, while the family was still residing in Singapore, the M obtained a maintenance order (“MO”) in favour of the twins. The MO provided for a monthly maintenance sum of $1,600 in total for both children. In addition, the F was to bear all school related expenses as well as a sum of $1,500 as accommodation/rental expenses. Eventually, the M would move to France with the twins shortly after the MO was issued while the F remained in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In February 2024, the M filed for enforcement of the said MO <em>vide</em> MSS 454/2024, alleging to have received only one payment thereunder, and sought to enforce arrears from May 2018 onwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       A few months later in July 2024, the F applied for variation of the MO to ‘zero’, <em>vide</em> MSS 1672/2024 and for the variation to be backdated to 2018 when the children started living in France as they were enjoying government benefits which presumably exceeded their needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Eventually I found that the M was entitled to arrears of <b>$105,600</b> from 2020 onwards. As for the F’s application, I ordered that he pay a reduced amount of maintenance of $1,091 from July 2025 onwards and rejected his request for backdated variation to 2018.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       These grounds of decision set out the court’s views on how social welfare benefits may be considered in the context of applications for enforcement and variation, and in particular whether they can amount to showing good cause for a payer defaulting in his maintenance obligations, and merit a reduction in maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       It also suggests general considerations in assessing reasonable expenses for a special needs child and seeks to elucidate the threshold of the legal burden on respondents in enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The names of the children in these grounds of decision are pseudonyms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties had resided in Singapore from 2015 onwards when the F’s work brought him here from France. Unfortunately, parties’ relationship broke down. In 2018, when the twins, Madeline and Antonio were three years old, the M applied for maintenance and obtained the MO on 6 April 2018. A few days later on 11 April 2018, parties entered into a consent order in an application launched by the F under the Guardianship of Infants Act (“the OSG orders”). Under the latter, parties had joint custody of the twins, and the M was allowed to relocate to France with the children while the F would be allowed to visit them annually.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Shortly after the OSG orders were granted, the M went to Cameroon to work and the children were cared for by her mother. Here and there, she got some financial support from her family members as the F did not send her maintenance. In the enforcement proceedings, the F would explain he had refused to do so as his payments into the designated bank account stated in the MO had bounced in September 2018, and he did not trust the alternative bank account number the M later personally furnished him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The twins were only diagnosed with autism sometime in 2019-2020. As the health authorities in Cameroon were unable to care for the twins, the M moved to France where the children could receive the necessary interventions and social welfare benefits. In the meantime, her request to the F to pay the maintenance into her French bank account was ignored. Between seeking government assistance for early intervention for the children and searching for appropriate school placements, the M would state that claiming maintenance arrears from the F was not her top priority.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In 2020, the M informed the F via Whatsapp that the children had severe special needs that required intervention. Her message was, according to the F, a bolt from the blue. In his own words<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[35]  Eventually, I received a Whatsapp message from [the M] saying that she had relocated to France with the children and that I should continue transferring the monies to a new bank account in France. I did not adhere to this as this was not what was in the said order. I was also not sure whose [account] this was as [the M] was only informing me about the account at that time. Following this, [the M] stopped communicating with me and she refused to give me details about her and the children’s whereabouts and deprived me from accessing or communicating with the children once again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[36]  Then suddenly in 2020, when the children were about 5 years old, [the M] sent me many photographs of the children and was sharing with me contacts from their school in France. I contacted the school shared by [the M] and a specialist in the school informed me that both the children, Madeline and Antonio were exhibiting verbal autism, with serious developmental delays. I was devastated upon receiving the said information and it made me wonder what [the M]’s intention was, for her to get the school to share this information with me at this point in time. <b>I was emotionally drained and eventually, I stopped communicating with [the M] and blocked her on Whatsapp and I was also trying to focus on my life and my employment here in Singapore.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<b>37</b>]   <b>Since then she did not communicate with me nor update me about the children. For the reasons as set out in the narrative above, I did not contact her and she did not contact me and we just proceeded with life.</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     This appeared to be the general state of affairs between parties until the M filed for enforcement. The F then appointed a registered French lawyer practising in a firm in Singapore, who attempted negotiations with the M to no avail. The said counsel then rendered an expert opinion on the benefits the M was potentially receiving in France. Suffice to say, parties were unable to resolve both applications out of court and both matters were fixed for hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The court’s findings</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Did s 121(3) of the Women’s Charter apply and if so, were there special circumstances?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     A preliminary issue was whether the M was entitled to enforce more than three years’ worth of maintenance given the restriction under section 121(3) of the Women’s Charter (“the Charter”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No amount owing as maintenance is recoverable in any suit if it accrued due more than 3 years before the institution of the suit <b>unless the court, under special circumstances, otherwise allows.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>[own emphasis]</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Women’s Charter (“Charter”) does not specify what qualifies as “special circumstances” under section 121(3). Generally, these are circumstances which are sufficiently persuasive in themselves that to ignore them would do great injustice to the party receiving maintenance (see <em>Koay Guat Kooi (mw) v Eddie Yeo</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6511-M.xml')\">[1997] SGHC 197</a> at [12]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The purpose of the time bar is to ensure that a respondent is not blindsided by a sudden and large amount of arrears that might cause hardship to him. This however, must be balanced against the hardship the applicant suffers if the time bar were to apply, and the principle that a respondent should not be permitted to profit from his/her own wrong.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I find that there were special circumstances in the present case. Taking care of a pair of young, non-verbal autistic twins on her own while also desperately seeking intervention for them, it was understandable that enforcing maintenance was not the M’s priority. This is especially given the opportunity cost of having to fly to Singapore or appointing Singapore lawyer(s) to take out the necessary legal proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     That said, I only allowed the M to claim unpaid maintenance from 2020 onwards. I accepted that there had been poor to almost no communication between the parties and insofar as the F’s reason for defaulting was because he was unaware of the children’s whereabouts, by 2020 it would have been patently clear to him that the children were residing in France when the M messaged him over Whatsapp and shared with him a list of specialists in Singapore he could reach out to in order to secure intervention for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     From January 2020 till June 2025 (the month of the hearings), this was a period of 66 months. The arrears for this period came up to $105,600 based on the fixed monthly maintenance of $1,600. I disallowed the M’s claim for arrears in relation to the children’s therapy and related expenses as I agreed with counsel for the F, Mr Dodwell, that these fell outside the scope of the MO as they did not appear to be required by the children’s school. The court can only enforce what an order provides for. Arrears for accommodation expenses were also excluded from enforcement at the M’s request – she candidly pointed out that her accommodation was being paid for by the French government.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has the F ‘shown good cause’ for failing to pay maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Having established the quantum of arrears that was enforceable under section 71 of the Charter, the next inquiry was whether the F had furnished good reasons at law, for failing to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">To ‘show cause’ and ‘show good cause’</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Section 71 enforcement proceedings are commonly known as ‘show cause’ proceedings. In <em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [10], it was held that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the quintessential characteristic of enforcement proceedings is the opportunity that is made available to the Respondent to “show cause” (which is the term found in the summons that is served on Respondents generally…)…or in simple language, “show reason” why the maintenance in arrears should not be enforced in full…or in part.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, P.3, r.15(3) provides that if the enforcement court intends to impose a sentence of imprisonment for arrears owing as of the time of the enforcement application, the court must, before imposing the sentence of imprisonment, require the respondent’s personal attendance in court and -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    give the respondent the opportunity –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the respondent has made the payment or payments required to be made under a maintenance order; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   to <b>show cause</b> for the respondent’s failure to make the payment or payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></em>, the learned author observes that the expression “show cause”:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… does not imply that a mere opportunity of submitting an explanation is enough. It implies that adequate opportunity of leading evidence in support of the contentions raised against his [<em>sic</em>] must be given and where necessary, opportunity of cross-examining witness of the other side and of addressing arguments be afforded. <em>Shyamlal v State of UP</em> AIR 1954 All 235 at 234.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     From the above definitions of ‘show cause’, it can be gleaned that it is an important <em>procedure</em> where a respondent explains his/her default and to that end, the respondent is to be allowed to examine and cross-examine witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     That the term ‘show cause’ in the context of maintenance enforcement proceedings has historically been used in subsidiary legislation rather than primary legislation, may give rise to the perception that ‘show cause’ is primarily a matter of procedure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     But ‘show cause’ also has a substantive dimension to it, which is that the respondent’s explanation must persuade the court that there was good reason for his/her conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     This requirement for the explanation to satisfy the court is rather implicit and it may not be readily apparent to parties in enforcement proceedings what the content of the burden to ‘show cause’ consists of. Indeed, if the casual excuses respondents in enforcement proceedings often give are any indication, some exposition on the content of this obligation could be helpful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the case of <em>VUJ v VUK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26500-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 87</a>, the court listed some examples where the court found that a respondent had shown cause, and I gratefully reproduce [21] of the judgment here:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    where the parties had mutually agreed to a reduction of the amount payable pursuant to maintenance order or where there was an understanding (whether implicit or explicit) between the parties not to require strict compliance with the terms of the said order (see for eg.,<em>Lai Ching Kin v Ng Chin Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/7316-M.xml')\">[2001] SGDC 228</a> at [15], <em>UAE v UAF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20191-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 46</a> at [24] – [28] and <em>VAM v VAN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23625-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 96</a>);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    where the respondent had went over and beyond what was required under the maintenance order and/or had provided additional support to the complainant even though the payment modality may not have been exactly in accordance with the terms of the maintenance order (see <em>TDR v TDS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGDC 0183.xml')\">[2014] SGDC 183</a> at [22] – [27]);</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    where a complainant had used monies belonging to the respondent to pay for expenses which were within the scope of the maintenance order such that the respondent should be treated as having paid for those expenses (see for eg. <em>TXY v TXZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 21</a>); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    where a respondent had a good track record of payment but is facing genuine financial difficulties in keeping up with the payments (see for eg.<em>VSP v VSQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26200-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGFC 71</a>, a case involving financial difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is not difficult to appreciate in the scenarios outlined above why the court found that the respondent had shown good reasons for not paying maintenance. Less intuitive for respondents though, is why the court refuses to accept a lack of a respondent’s access to his/her child, or a respondent’s unilateral deduction from the fixed maintenance sum expenses which the respondent incurred for the child on his/her own volition (and without the care and control parent’s consent or knowledge), as amounting to ‘showing cause’.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Why do such reasons not amount to ‘showing cause’? It is this court’s view that how enforcement proceedings have proceeded in the courts thus far is for the respondent to show ‘<em>good</em> cause’ that would excuse his default in paying maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The term ‘good cause’ appears in section 72 of the Charter, which sets out the threshold for the rescission and variation of a maintenance order:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>72.</b>—(1)    On the application of any person receiving or ordered to pay monthly sums under this Part and on proof of a change in the circumstances of that person, or that person’s wife, incapacitated husband or child, <b>or for other good cause being shown to the satisfaction of the court</b>, the court by which the order was made may rescind the order or may vary it as it thinks fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Section 91O of the recently amended Charter<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> also requires a respondent to “show good cause” as to why he defaulted on his maintenance obligations under a show payment order, failing which, the default term of imprisonment takes effect:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">91O.—(1)    Where a court has specified a term of imprisonment under section 81(2)(d) or (4)(a)(ii) in respect of a respondent, the court may sentence the respondent to imprisonment if —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the respondent fails to prove to the satisfaction of the court, by any date specified under section 81(2)(c) or (4)(a)(i) in respect of an amount to be paid, that the respondent has paid that amount by the date specified in the order under section 81(2)(b) or (4)(a)(i)(A) (as the case may be) for payment of that amount; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    the court is satisfied that the respondent has shown no good cause for his or her failure mentioned in paragraph (a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     While not defined in the Charter, ‘good cause’ is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary (12<sup>th</sup> Ed., 2014)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> as:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A legally sufficient reason. <b>Good cause is often the burden placed on a litigant (usu. by court rule or order) to show why a request should be granted or an action excused</b>…Also termed good cause shown; just cause; lawful cause; sufficient cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     It is: “Reason which is found to be adequate or proper and justified by a court or a competent authority dealing with the matter.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (2002 ed) defines ‘good cause’ as: “a cause or reason sufficient in law, or that is based on equity or justice or that would motivate a reasonable man under all the circumstances.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     If ‘good cause’ is required before a maintenance order can be varied or rescinded, and to avoid imprisonment for breaching a show payment order, then it seems only logical that the same threshold be imposed when there has been a default in maintenance. Indeed, the intrinsic importance of maintenance demands as such. It is not enough for a respondent to simply “show reason” – he/she must “show good reason” that satisfies the Court. As Sachs LJ put in <em>Jones v Jones</em> [1970] 3 All ER 47 at 55:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…‘good cause’ …is a phrased adopted by Lord Denning MR both in Baker v Bowkett’s Cakes Ltd [1966] 2 All ER 290…’[g]ood reason’ is a phrase used by Lord Goddard in Battersby v Anglo-American Oil Co Ltd [1944] 2 All ER 387; [1945] KB 23. For my part, I would prefer that <b>no gloss be put on these two phrases, which have a precisely similar meaning.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     A respondent in enforcement proceedings needs to proffer good reasons that are established at law or founded in equity, buttressed by sufficient and cogent evidence, as to why he or she should be excused from the default in maintenance. This is the burden of proof the respondent bears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Whereas the traditional term of ‘show cause’ may appear to litigants to refer primarily to the procedure of allowing a respondent to provide an explanation for his default and to challenge opposing arguments and evidence made against him, the phrase ‘show good cause’ renders it expressly clear that the respondent also produces legally sufficient reasons for his request in order that his conduct is excused.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     So while an enforcement application may often be referred to as a ‘show cause’ proceeding, it is this Court’s view that the burden is really for a respondent to ‘show good cause’. This is consistent with the prevailing practice in the Family Justice Courts and aligns with the burden of proof in the Charter for variation proceedings, and a respondent explaining his default under a show payment order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s reasons for defaulting on the maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The F in his affidavit spoke of how the M had not given him access to the twins and how he was unable to see the children despite having joint custody of them. I found that even if this were true, it was irrelevant. A child’s basic needs require no articulation – it is a matter of common sense that a child needs food, shelter, clothing and education provided for them because they are unable to provide for themselves. As the High Court in <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a> remarked at [48]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A parent ought to be aware that provision for basic needs would be required, whether or not a specific request for basic needs has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     While the Court’s remarks above were in the context of an application for a maintenance order, the same reasoning applies equally in enforcement proceedings. Every child needs to be maintained regardless of whether there is an order in force, and whether the parent has access to the child. Such is the duty of a parent enshrined under section 68 of the Charter – it exists independently of an order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Where a maintenance order has been made, it is expected to be complied with regardless of a parent’s subjective feelings. It is worth iterating that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">All court orders must be complied with. A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(at [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22373-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 15</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The F’s alleged lack of access even if it were proven, was irrelevant to the F’s liability to pay. It was not a reason that can be sustained at law or equity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     For completeness, I add that if the F genuinely had concerns over access, it was always open to him to take out proceedings in Singapore where he is based, or in France, for access to the children. After all, he appeared to have easy access to French counsel and affordability of counsel was not an issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     It appeared that the F’s alleged difficulties with access was a smokescreen - he simply did not want to maintain the twins. This as much was clear when he stated that he blocked the M when she reached out to him in 2020 about the children’s condition. Instead, he “just wanted to focus on his life in Singapore (see [12] above).”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     It is this court’s view that the F had wilfully shut his eyes towards the needs of his children and his maintenance obligations under the MO. He appeared to have accepted that the children were living in France when he blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020, yet he refused to pay the maintenance into a French bank account which details the M had provided back in 2018. His basis for not doing so because it was a different account number from that in the MO was with respect, rich. On one hand he was expecting of the M a fastidious adherence to the MO down to a technical detail of a bank account number, yet on the other hand, he was blatantly breaching the MO by refusing to pay maintenance despite the M herself providing an alternative bank account. Clearly, he was contravening the spirit and substance of the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Another ground the F had relied on to preclude enforcement, was that the children were being maintained in France and receiving generous benefits from the government. The M was receiving the following benefits based on her own evidence:</p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col

foregoing, the F submitted that the MO not be enforced against him, especially since it had been made in the context of Singapore’s standard of living as reflected in the judge’s brief grounds of decision when it issued the MO. Mr Dodwell stated in his submissions, “the order was contextually and geographically specific, reflecting the financial demands of raising children in Singapore without state support.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The F submitted that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…the relocation of the Mother and children to France combined with their access to comprehensive, ongoing, and state-funded support under the French social welfare system renders the continued enforcement of [the MO] unnecessary, unjustified, and inequitable. The French government, through the Caisse d’Allocations Familiales (“CAF”), provides a robust system of family-related welfare benefits, including monthly cash transfers and subsidies covering housing, education, childcare, and healthcare.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The family’s eligibility for these entitlements is directly linked to the Father’s nationality and status. As a result, the Mother and children receive substantial and regular public financial assistance that directly meets the essential needs for which [the MO] was originally intended.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my view, the above reasoning was <em>ex post facto</em>. When the F ceased to pay maintenance, he was unaware of the specific benefits the children and the M were receiving. He simply was not interested in maintaining the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Would the M be “profiting” if the MO was enforced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     But leaving aside the F’s subjective basis for not paying maintenance, objectively speaking, should the fact that the French government was financially supporting the children during the period of default amount to good cause for not paying the maintenance? Would the fact that the children had received government benefits since 2020 mean that the M will be receiving a windfall or profiting somewhat should the MO be enforced against the F, a point alluded to in the F’s submissions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     There are three considerations at play in this context. The first is that court orders are to be adhered to unless and until varied or discharged by law. In <em>Madison Pacific Trust Limited and ors v PT Dewata Wibawa</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24926-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHC 184</a> at [73] the High Court cited Mark S W Hoyle, <em>Freezing and Search Orders </em>(Informa, 4th Ed, 2006) at para 9.17 (cited with approval in <em>Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLC and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 2 SLR(R) 0518.xml')\">[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518</a> at [82]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is no defence to contempt proceedings to allege that the order should not have been made, or has been discharged. <b>An order of the court must be obeyed while it stands</b>, and a breach is still contempt even if, at a later stage, the order is in fact discharged. <b>The same principle applies if the original order was wrongly made; the defendant’s remedy is to apply for its immediate discharge while keeping to its terms.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Court orders are to be obeyed, until varied or discharged at law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     Second, the law does not assist the indolent. The F has been based in Singapore since 2018 and has had access to local lawyers. In fact, he was legally represented in the maintenance proceedings and could have easily obtained legal advice on his ongoing maintenance obligations. This he could have done as early as September 2018 when his transfers to the M’s Cameroon bank account bounced and she had furnished him her French bank account details, or in 2020, when he received the M’s Whatsapp messages of the children suffering from severe autism and being in France. The F could have then taken out an application to vary or rescind the MO to cease his maintenance obligations owing to the benefits the children were receiving from the French government. He did none of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Last but not least, it is to be emphasised that “A litigant is entitled to receive what he or she is entitled to under a court order” (see [15] of <em>UNE v UNF</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     In view of the principles outlined above, it is my view that the M having received government benefits on behalf of the children, whether they were equal to or even exceeded her entitlement under the MO during the period of default, did not amount to good cause as to why the MO ought not to be enforced against the F. And on this note, I rejected the submission that any variation of the MO be backdated to 2018 for the same reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     For completeness, I add that I find it unlikely that the M would be “profiting” from the enforcement of the MO. She explained having to refund the French government the Family Support Allowance once the F pays up the arrears. This was also alluded to by the F’s own French lawyer, who prepared an expert opinion on the benefits the M was likely receiving in France. Therein, the said French lawyer mentioned that a recovery claim may be filed against the debtor (the missing/defaulting parent). This would not be inconsistent with the M’s claim that the government can claw back such monies from her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, the M testified (and this was undisputed) how she would be out of pocket for the utilities by some 322 euros each month and additionally, how she has paid for therapeutic interventions for the children (which she has not been allowed to claim as arrears in these enforcement proceedings). Ultimately, it was apparent that the M has been out of pocket for the children’s expenses all these years, and the enforcement monies will go some way towards addressing this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Orders made on the enforcement application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The arrears from January 2020 to date (including June 2025) stood at $105,600. The aggregate amount appears staggering, but is only so because of the long period of default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The F’s nett pay exceeded $20,000 per month and based on his latest notice of assessment, his average monthly income was some $30,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Taking these figures into account, the long period of default, and the large amount of arrears, I ordered that the arrears be paid off in monthly instalments as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_i\"></a>(i)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 October 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 November 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_iv\"></a>(iv)     Sum of $10,000 by 20 December 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_v\"></a>(v)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 January 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_62-p2_vi\"></a>(vi)     Sum of $5,000 by 20 February 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The F was ordered to show payment online for each of these payments. The remaining arrears were to be paid off in monthly instalments of $5,000 with effect from 20 March 2026.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The variation application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ respective positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     As adverted to earlier, the F had applied for the MO to be varied to ‘zero’ and such variation to be backdated to when the children started residing in France and started receiving government benefits. Mr Dodwell submitted that the “children’s welfare is adequately provided for without reliance on contributions from the Father.” Additionally, he pointed out a “financial surplus” for them as they were being maintained at a standard of living that is “comparable, if not superior, to what was envisaged when [the MO] was originally made in the context of Singapore.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     Counsel also contended that there was no financial hardship demonstrated by the M in relation to the children’s upkeep. Imposing maintenance on the F would thus be “an unnecessary and duplicative financial obligation, which is inconsistent with the principles of proportionality and equity underpinning Singapore’s family law regime.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The M on the other hand stated that at the time the MO was made, the children were not yet diagnosed with autism, and that the F’s variation application was a red-herring designed to confuse. It would be unjust if the F was allowed to escape his maintenance obligations by applying for backdated variation. He also ought not to rely on the French government for the children’s maintenance when he was more than capable of supporting them as their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The M thus asked that the current clauses in the MO remain, save for the clause pertaining to accommodation as this was provided by the French government. She submitted having to pay for the children’s food, specialists, clothes, toys and holidays, and their needs can be expected to evolve as they grow up. She also has to top up 322 euros for utilities each month. She was unable to work as she needed to care for them and ferry them to their various therapies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Has there been a change in circumstances or good cause to vary the maintenance order?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Section 72 empowers the court to vary a maintenance where there has been a change in circumstances or good cause to do so. There was indeed a change in circumstances, given that at the time the MO was made, the children were undiagnosed and parties were residing in Singapore with the judge stating that her determination on the MO was “premised on the children remaining in Singapore and incurring expenses in Singapore.” Now that the M is residing in France and receiving benefits, this also amounts to a change in circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The F’s objections to the children’s expenses </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     Some of the twins’ needs were disputed by the F as seen

desire for the children. In particular, it was the various therapies and intervention that the F objected to, because he had not been consulted and there was no proof that these were medically necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">‘Reasonable maintenance’– an objective-subjective approach and its application to ‘special needs’ children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In assessing reasonable maintenance for a child, the court is largely concerned with the reasonableness of the nature and quantum of such expenses (<em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23233-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 12</a>). This is largely an objective exercise, but concurrently one that requires a value judgment of the court as to what is reasonable against all the circumstances of the case. Hence, the High Court observed at [47]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Suppose, hypothetically, the mother of a child does not consult the father about enrolling the child in horseback-riding classes that cost $1,500 a month. The father is of the view that their family of five, with a monthly household income of $9,000, cannot afford such an expense, and such expenses are in any case not the more common ones such as those arising from academic tuition classes or music and swimming enrichment classes. If the father refuses to pay for the horseback-riding classes, can he be said to have refused to provide reasonable maintenance? Another hypothetical example is where a mother purchases a car for their 19-year-old child and requests the father to pay for the car, being the child’s “transport expenses”. Some disagreement or resistance to less common and reasonable expenses is not inevitably a refusal to provide maintenance. <b>Naturally, this assessment of reasonableness is dependent on all the facts and circumstances of the case including the standard of living enjoyed by the child and the family.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     There is thus in my view, an objective-subjective approach that the court adopts when assessing what <em>type</em> of expense is reasonable for a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Likewise, with the quantum of expenses, there is similarly an objective-subjective approach. Hence, the court does not require receipts to assess what a reasonable quantum for groceries would be for an average Singaporean household – the universal, shared experience or knowledge of how much bread, milk costs etcetera is needed by an average family and how it is necessary for daily living – means that receipts are not strictly required:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The law does not require that every specific item of expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. More exceptional expenses though, such as certain medical needs and costs, ought to be supported by evidence. ([13] of <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     However, where the family in question enjoys a higher standard of living than the average Singaporean family, then for the same type of expense, it can be contemplated that a higher quantum may be reasonable to align with or approximate towards the family’s standard of living, insofar as this is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. There is thus the element of subjectivity that still hews to the requirement of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Hence, where more extraordinary expenses are concerned, these should be proven. Even so, the court may find that while such expenses are being incurred, they do not necessarily fall within the ambit of reasonableness. In <em>WLE v WLE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a>, the High Court remarked at [21]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The fact that an item of expenditure has been paid for does not necessarily mean that it is a reasonable expense for which maintenance must be ordered under the Charter: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [9]. Moreover, these payments were made post-divorce and the decision to incur this expenditure is, in my opinion, a unilateral decision of the Husband based on his parenting style. The law does not hold back the Husband from indulging the daughter, but it also cannot compel the Wife to contribute to such indulgence. In the unfortunate breakdown of a family, the question of maintenance is limited Version No 2: 05 Apr 2023 (17:15 hrs) <em>WLE v WLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a> 15 to a test of reasonableness. Accordingly, the court will only order divorcing parties to pay what is reasonable for the child, and no more. The reasonable expenses of the daughter, as calculated, is $1,941.67 but I will round it to $2,000.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     In the present case, the children’s expenses were certainly not run-of-the mill. The F submitted that the intervention and therapy were not proven to be medically necessary and hence he ought not to pay on them (aside from the fact that he was not consulted).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     While indeed there were no reports produced by the M stating the medical necessity of these interventions, what was available however, were reports speaking of the twins benefitting from such therapy and intervention and the positive progress they had made. The F did not challenge the veracity of such reports nor produce any expert report rebutting the utility of such intervention and therapy for the twins.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The High Court at [67] of <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> observed, a care and control parent</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">...is in a far better position than [the access parent] to know what will best promote the children’s welfare at any point in time, both in the short-term and for the long-term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     The F’s objection grounded on the lack of consultation would have held more sway had he not chosen to deliberately distance himself from the children. Indeed, it appeared that he was determinedly uninvolved in the children’s lives since the consent order in the OSG proceedings was entered into on 10 April 2018 where it had merely provided that the F, a France national, “shall endeavour to visit [the children in France] on an <em>annual</em> basis and have reasonable access” to them. During the proceedings, it emerged that it was the M who had insisted on this clause to ensure he could be involved in the children’s lives. Yet, there was no evidence in the proceedings or rebuttal of the M’s account, that the F had never carried out this thin obligation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Further, no response was forthcoming from the F when the M wrote him a letter seeking specialist intervention for the twins and furnishing him the contact details of various specialists in Singapore; he had also blocked the M on Whatsapp in 2020 to focus on his life in Singapore despite his claim that he was heartbroken upon hearing their diagnosis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The F’s actions – and inaction – made it patently clear that he wanted nothing to do with the twins. In my view, his deliberate failure to exercise his custodial rights means he cannot now rely on those same rights to insist on being consulted on the children’s therapy and intervention before he is made to pay on them. While this Court will not go so far as to suggest there is an estoppel by conduct, it is hard to see how the ends of justice would be served if the M, the sole caregiver of special needs twins, was to be penalised for giving up on engaging the F.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Pertinently, for the F to now raise objections to the children’s therapy, means that if such objections are allowed, the M will have to alter the children’s routines and lifestyles after having single-handedly raised them for the last seven years, devoid of the F’s input. This would indubitably be detrimental to the children’s interests, especially when they have made progress.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     All this said, it would be desirable for the F to consider playing a more active role in the children’s lives as he remains their father and the children can only benefit from his care and concern of them. If he had been an absent father before, he can choose to be an active one today which the M stressed she was always desirous of.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     Where special needs children are concerned, it is this Court’s view that the element of subjectivity may necessarily have to be take on a broader role while still being subject to the touchstone of reasonableness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     There is no universal definition of ‘special needs’, though the OCED (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) has described this as “…a term used in many education systems to characterise the broad array of needs of students who are affected by disabilities or disorders that affect their learning and development. There is a wide range of policy responses to provide support to students with special education needs.” <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     Indeed, with special needs children, their needs can be varied and multifarious, particularly in terms of the intervention and therapies required. In assessing what is reasonable for a special needs child, it is this Court’s view that the Court can accord <em>greater latitude</em> to the care and control parent in deciding the type of care and therapy the child receives because <em>generally</em>, it will be the care and control parent who is most uniquely placed to understand the child’s needs. This already is the general position (see [77] above) and must apply with greater force where special needs children are concerned, especially where they are uncommunicative or have certain dispositions which only their caregiver understands. The experience of caring for special needs children is less amenable to generalisation and there should be some leeway afforded to the care and control parent’s assessment which may have to take into account even the child’s own subjective preferences and predilections.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     How would this play out? Suppose the following hypothetical. Parties are residing in Singapore and the care and control parent seeks to secure intervention in the UK for their 8-year-old son who is autistic. Objectively speaking, the nature of the intervention and the quantum of the expenses involved would unlikely be reasonable. This is because local intervention is quite readily available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     What if however, the parties had relocated from the UK to Singapore six months ago and the child had already been undergoing intervention before the family arrived in Singapore whereupon parties’ marriage immediately broke down? The stress of the divorce proceedings has adversely impacted the child and the care and control parent strongly believes that their son needs a familiar environment. Progress in Singapore has also been much slower than in the UK. In these circumstances, the care and control parent’s claim for the expenses incurred in flying the child to the UK for intervention, does not appear <em>wholly</em> unreasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Of course, the court will also have to consider parties’ financial positions against the total expenses for such intervention, amongst other factors. After all, section 69(4) of the Charter provides that the court “shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     In another hypothetical, what if a care and control parent seeks out an experimental therapy or intervention for a condition with no medical opinion evidence of its benefits? In this regard, the court may have to assess the reasonableness of the parent’s belief that the intervention is likely to work on the child and to this end, subjective considerations may be taken into account such as the child’s proclivities and behavioural traits. While an experimental therapy unbacked by clinical trial results may sound like claptrap to one, if a special needs child is refusing conventional therapy and the untested therapy represents a sliver of hope of successful intervention, is it wholly unreasonable to give it a try?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The assessment of what is reasonable for special needs children thus cannot be viewed through a simple, singular lens of whether a particular expense is objectively reasonable in nature or its quantum – what is <em>un</em>reasonable for an average child may be reasonable for a special needs child. For instance, it may be reasonable for a special needs child who is non-verbal or devoid of social skills to undergo animal-assisted therapy. This may not, <em>without more</em>, be reasonable for children who do not have special needs, and the court may be slow to allow for animal-assisted therapy if conventional therapy is available.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     And even as there is the requirement of reasonableness, it should not be forgotten that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>The paramount consideration in all proceedings involving children is the welfare of the child. This principle is the “golden thread” that runs through all proceedings directly affecting the interests of children</b>: <em>BNS v BNT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17588-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 3 SLR 973</a> at [19]). The welfare principle ensures that the children’s interests are not side-lined while their parents litigate over their various disputes. Parental responsibility is crucial in upholding the welfare principle and is a serious<em> legal</em> obligation not to be taken lightly. (at [1] of <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31008-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 1</a>)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     All this said, in assessing the reasonableness of the type of intervention, there must be a modicum of evidence that: (a) such intervention is required; (b) is ongoing and benefitting the child, or (c) has not yet commenced but is likely to benefit the child. Where there is little objective evidence suggesting an intervention’s utility or benefit, the Court may have to be more circumspect in allowing such expenses to be claimed, whilst being sensitive to the fact that the care and control parent is likely to have more insight into what the child requires. The absence or lack of evidence does not necessarily mean the intervention or therapy is unreasonable; its presence <em>generally</em> militates towards its reasonableness, unless the other parent can prove otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     At this juncture, it is apposite to address a frequent contention often raised by payers of maintenance, which is that the care and control parent is artificially inflating expenses. This often rears its head in maintenance, variation and sometimes, enforcement proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Certainly, it is not uncommon for expenses to be inflated and exaggerated in such proceedings. However, to cynically run such an argument in relation to therapy and intervention expenses for a special needs child, ignores the realities of raising and caring for a special needs child and is rather affronting to the care and control parent. Most such parents act in good faith; they genuinely believe in the need for intervention and are anxious for early and successful intervention. Almost always, the care and control parent also bears part of the costs of the intervention and therapy. Such intervention thus comes at a personal cost as well – there is no pecuniary gain from this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     At the same time, it is recognised that there is a wide spectrum of ‘special needs’ in terms of type and severity and one cannot discount the <em>possibility</em> of the care and control parent being overzealous in “diagnosing” or “labelling” their child. That said, an official diagnosis may take too long to obtain and the care and control parent may be acting on little more than one’s parental instincts. The parent should not be prejudiced simply for not producing an official report or memo, but each case ultimately turns on its unique facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     Ultimately, the burden still rests on a parent claiming maintenance (or seeking a variation or enforcement as the case may be) to prove the reasonableness of such expenses and there is no presumption that any therapy or intervention a parent <em>unilaterally</em> decides upon is reasonable for the purpose of claiming or enforcing maintenance for a special needs child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">To what extent should state benefits be considered in assessing maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The benefits received by the M are a financial resource for the M and should be factored into the calculation of maintenance that is needed. However, I do not imagine state supported schemes or benefits to be munificent in the same way that parents themselves can be expected to be with their children. Social welfare benefits usually cater for a baseline standard of living – this is apparent from how <em>none</em> of the state benefits the children receive appear to be dedicated towards therapy or intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     If the benefits the M and the children are receiving appear to be on the high end, this underscores the severity of the children’s disabilities and the M’s predicament as a single mother who is the twins’ sole caregiver. Put another way, it is the unenviability of their situation that allows them to claim this amount of benefits, not that they are enjoying a “comparable or superior standard of living, to what was envisaged by the MO”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     Maintenance is a fundamental, parental responsibility. Government benefits, like any other financial resource (eg. savings, inheritance, donations, sponsorship), do not and should not absolve a parent altogether from paying maintenance. The Court has repeatedly iterated the “equal but differentiated responsibilities” of parents, and the fact that one parent is able to fully financially support a child does not mean that the other parent is then allowed to abdicate his/her responsibility to maintain the child – see <em>AUA v ATZ</em> [2016] 4 SLR 690 at [41] and [45]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[41]  Section 68 states that a parent’s duty is to provide what is “reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in life”. This is buttressed by s 69(4) of the Charter, which specifically directs the court to have regard to “all the circumstances of the case”, including, among other things, the income and earning capacities of the wife and child in deciding what sum to order in maintenance. Undergirding these provisions is the principle which we would, to borrow an expression from another area of the law, call the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: <b>both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, but their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities</b> (see <em>TIT v TIU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19108-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1137</a> at [61]). The Charter clearly contemplates that parents may contribute in different ways and to different extents in the discharge of their common duty to provide for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[45]  …the welfare of the child was best advanced if both parents played an active role in the upbringing of the child, even if they might not continue to live together. We affirm this principle and we hold that it applies with equal force to the area of material provision<b>. Even if one parent were fully capable of providing for the child’s material needs, it would still be in the best interests of the child, and consistent with the scheme of the Charter as a whole, that the law recognises and enforces the joint responsibility of both parents to maintain the child. This is I keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities</b>…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[own emphasis]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Court is not the child’s parent<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>. Neither is any government. To suggest that the government is fully supporting a child and hence maintenance need not be paid, makes a mockery of one’s parental duty and responsibility.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Eventual variation of the maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    Given that it was only after the making of the MO that the children were diagnosed with autism, the order ought to be varied such that their special needs can be catered for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    The children’s basic living expenses are provided for by the government benefits. The therapy and interventions are the main source of divergence in parties’ estimates. After factoring in the state benefits the M was receiving, the M had a deficit of 738.18 euros according to her estimates, while the F’s estimates yielded a surplus of 1060.56 euros.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    In the present case, it was evident that the therapy the children had been attending was benefitting them. Given the circumstances of the case and how they had been raised by the M single-handedly, I saw no reason to vary the maintenance order to ‘zero’, which would effectively exclude the therapy and intervention expenses, finding that to do so would be inimical to the twin’s best interests.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Instead, the sum of $1,600 in the MO should be replaced with the sum of $1,091 in total for both children – this is the equivalent of 738.18 euros based on the exchange rate stated on the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s website as of 18 June 2025 ($1.4776 to 1 euro). This was to take effect from 25 July 2025 onwards. By addressing this deficit through a reduced sum of maintenance, this ensures that the children’s needs are not compromised whilst at the same time sufficiently taking into consideration the benefits the children are already receiving. I had considered the high-income earning capacity of the F and the children’s standard of living which was adverted to by the judge who issued the MO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I further varied the order to provide for a clause that allows for therapy/intervention options not covered under the MO or by insurance, to be discussed between parties. This was to promote the F’s right as a joint custodial parent. The M readily agreed to such a clause and this was welcomed by Mr Dodwell as well. The F would not be liable to pay on such expenses if he was not consulted but if he was and there was no agreement, he would bear 50% of such expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Costs of $1,000 was ordered to be paid by the F to the M for the enforcement application and each party was to bear their own costs for the variation application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    Despite their geographical distance and emotional baggage, I hope the F and the M can find a way to coparent and for the F to be involved in his children’s lives.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[35] – [37] of the F’s affidavit of evidence in chief, affirmed on 30 September 2024.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Anandan Krishnan, <em>Words, Phrases &amp; Maxims Legally &amp; Judicially Defined</em>, Vol. 8, (2008 Ed, Lexis Nexis), p 664.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>The Charter as of 16 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Black’s Law Dictionary, Chief Editor Bryan A.

In some cases, the parties use incorporated legal entities to carry out the business, while some maintain unincorporated business structures or organisations, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       While the use of the business structures during the marriage is often up to the spouses’ choice (which could be motivated by personal or commercial reasons), how these businesses were dealt with in the context of the ancillary proceedings following the spouses’ divorce may bring about some interesting legal questions, including what parts of these businesses constitutes matrimonial assets and how they ought to be valued. Indeed, these questions may be further complicated when both spouses treated the ownership of the family business informally throughout the marriage. These were some of the issues which the Court had to address when determining the ancillary matters (“AM”) for FC/D 3654/2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The present case involves a marriage of approximately 21 years. The Plaintiff-Wife (“Wife”) and the Defendant-Husband (“Wife”) have one daughter, [E], born in 2014. Interim judgment for divorce (“IJ”) was granted to the parties on 7 February 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       I heard the AM proceedings on 24 July 2025 (“AM Hearing”), during which, both parties’ counsel confirmed that the following AM issues were disputed:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the division of matrimonial assets pursuant to s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the maintenance payable to the Wife and [E], post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>There were no live disputes in relation to the [E]’s custody and/or care arrangements as a consent order was recorded as part of the IJ (“Child Care Orders”), and these matters were <em>not</em> adjourned to be determined as part of the AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In these grounds of decision, I will first address the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets, followed by the Wife’s claim for maintenance for both herself and [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Matrimonial Asset Pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I start by considering the parties’ pool of matrimonial assets (“Matrimonial Pool”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       As I had alluded to above, this issue took on some significance in the present proceedings given the manner in which the parties’ managed the family’s business. In particular, the parties had disagreed over the treatment of several key assets, including what the Wife referred to as the Husband’s “Fruit &amp; Vegetable Business”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> This is, in fact, a reference to the sole proprietorship business, <em>viz.</em>[EFVT] (“Business”), currently registered in the Husband’s name.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It arose, in the course of the AM hearing, that the nature, and valuation, of the Business was a serious point of contention between the parties. At the Wife’s counsel’s request, I directed both counsel to file further written submissions on these matters.

It remained in the Husband’s possession as at the IJ date, and was only sold thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In fairness, the Husband did not challenge the fact that the vehicle was part of the Matrimonial Pool. Instead, the parties mainly disagreed on the value to be ascribed to the said vehicle. The Wife’s case was that a value of “<em>at the very least $100,000</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> should be used, whereas the Husband asked that the vehicle’s actual sale price of $60,000 be adopted.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife’s principal point was that this asset was sold by the Husband at an undervalue.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> To substantiate her case, she exhibited screenshots of online car sales listings and websites showing similar vehicle models (ie. Mercedes-Benz GLC 250) where the asking price exceeded $100,000.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In my view, the asking price for a vehicle as listed on these websites do not necessarily reflect its actual value. Different considerations and factors affect the value of a motor vehicle, including the condition of the vehicle, its detailed technical specifications, and its mileage. The use of screenshots of online platforms as a means of valuation was thus too speculative. I therefore could not agree with the Wife’s arguments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On the Husband’s part, he provided a sale and purchase agreement with one “RJ Leasing” showing that the car was <em>in fact</em> sold for the sum of $60,000. In the absence of any evidence showing any impropriety with the transaction, I accepted that the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle represented its market value at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     For completeness, the Wife also alleged that the Husband had failed to “account” for the sale proceeds was a separate matter he had received. In my view this was a separate matter and was not relevant to question of the asset’s value. In any case, the Husband had clearly indicated that he was prepared to “split” the proceeds with the Wife as part of the division of their matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The question of accountability did not arise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I thus added the amount of $60,000 back into the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Luxury Watches</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The next dispute pertained to the parties’ luxury watches. Their dispute was two-fold: (i) they disagreed on who was holding on to these watches. The Wife claimed that the Husband was holding on to several watches, while the Husband argued that it was the Wife who had held on to them; and (ii) they disagreed at to the value to be ascribed to these watches.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I begin by answering the more important <em>anterior</em> question – <em>ie.</em> how many watches there were in the first place. The parties each took a different position – the Husband claimed that there were two such watches whereas the Wife claimed that there were four. To answer this question, I am ultimately guided by what was in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To support his claim, the Husband provided the sales invoices for two watches purchased from one “[J] Boutique” in December 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> These invoices were separately addressed to the Husband and Wife, with the total cost being $34,500 for both watches. The Wife, on the other hand, provided no evidence as to when the other two watches were purchased to substantiate her assertion that there were four watches in total.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For the above reason, I found that only two luxury watches (<em>ie.</em> those purchased in 2020) would be part of the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Next, I valued these timepieces at their purchase prices. I did so as there was a lack of clear evidence by both parties as to the watches’ current market value. The only alternative offered by the Wife was to ascribe what she called a “conservative” value of $15,000 per watch.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>However, I declined to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Even on its face, the Wife’s approach did not satisfactorily explain why her own watch (purchased for $10,500) would have increased in value by $42%, while the Husband’s watch’s value (purchased at $24,000) would have decreased by 40%, in the same period. As no evidence was tendered to buttress these claims, the Wife’s approach was both speculative and arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, insofar as the possession of the watches was concerned, I am prepared to accept the Wife’s case that, on a balance of probabilities, the Husband had possession of the watches. It was not disputed that the Wife had left the Matrimonial Flat to stay in a shelter in June 2023, and that a personal protection order as well as a CPS safety plan were made to ensure the Wife’s and the Child’s safety shortly thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     During this time, the Husband had sole occupation of the Matrimonial Flat but there was no documented claim that he had lost his Rolex watch until August 2023 (through his solicitors’ letter).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span><sup></sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Accordingly, given the surrounding circumstances and the inference drawn from the Husband’s contemporaneous conduct at the material time, I found it more likely that the Husband had kept the watches in his possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cash on Hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife next alleged that the Husband had a habit of keeping a significant amount of cash at home (up to $100,000), in light of the cash-dependent nature of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> Her counsel submitted that I should infer that the Husband likely had such an amount of money kept at home at any one time, which ten should be added to the Matrimonial Pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Having considered the evidence, I was not prepared to find that the Husband had a sum of $100,000 in cash stashed at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Wife supported her claim by reference to a message sent on 19 September 2022 where reference was made to existence of monies kept at home. In my view, the actual reference in the 19 September 2022 message was vague and unhelpful. The Wife merely mentioned in her message that “[e]<em>ven though you said that whatever amount I wanted, it’s in the drawer, but I know these are hard-earned money…</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> There was no specific description of where the “drawer” was located, nor was there any indication of the amount of money present therein. Importantly, there was also no written response from the Husband to the Wife’s assertion in her message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The Wife submitted that since the Husband did not actively deny this statement <em>made by her</em>, it meant that he acknowledged the truth of her statement. With respect, I am not persuaded that she had discharged her burden to prove this asset’s existence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In any case, even if that was true that there was some money in a “drawer” at home <em>in 2022</em>, there was insufficient evidence to justify the Court making an assumption that there was, as at the IJ date (2 years later), the same sum of $100,000 lying at home. It is trite law that what falls within the Matrimonial Pool ought to be determined as at the IJ date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Parties’ Business</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I turn now to address the nature, and relevance, of the Business and its impact on the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     On its face, the parties’ dispute appeared to be over the value which ought to be ascribed to the Business. The Wife claimed that the Business was worth at least $200,000,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span><sup></sup>while the Husband submitted there was no market value to the Business whatsoever (although he acknowledged that the Business’ net profits for 2023 were $35,000).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> She also submitted that the Business must have been a valuable one as a third-party had previously offered to purchase the Business for $150,000 some years earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     As noted at [8] above, I had raised my concern to counsel that in light of the Business being a sole proprietorship, it would have had no separate legal personality from the Husband. In such a situation, how did the Wife envisage this “asset” to be divided between the parties?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To put matters in context, the present situation was unlike cases where the spouses’ business vehicle an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company) where what was to be divided in the divorce were the shares they held in the said company. In such cases, the question before the court would be the value <em>of these shares</em> (which are clearly assets they own).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, as the Business in the present case was a sole proprietorship, the Business’ assets (<em>eg.</em> cash, bank account monies, inventory, etc.) would have already been accounted for as part of the Husband’s <em>personal</em> assets since the Business had no distinct legal personality from the Husband, nor was it capable of holding assets in its own name. It was therefore unclear what the “valuation” which the Wife claimed should be attached to the Business relate to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     In response to the Court’s concerns, the Wife’s counsel sought leave for the parties to file further written submissions to address the same. In the Wife’s supplemental submissions, she recrafted her case and argued that the Business would include a measure “goodwill”. The existence of such “goodwill” meant that the Business had some form of intrinsic value, making it an asset divisible pursuant to s 112 of the WC,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> despite being a sole proprietorship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Having considered her counsel’s submissions, I was unable to agree with the Wife’s position. In my view, the Business <em>in the present case</em> was not an independent matrimonial asset which the Court could divide. I will explain my reasons in the following paragraphs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Distinction between “value” and “asset”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     At the outset, I found it important to draw a conceptual distinction between valuing something (<em>ie</em>. ascribing something with a monetary value) on the one hand, and describing a thing as an asset (in the proprietary sense) on the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     While values can be ascribed to many types of properties or assets, not everything capable of being valued is an “asset” divisible in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Take, for example, a painter’s ability to paint a picture. Someone may pay a lot of money to commission him to paint, but his painting ability is not an asset in the proprietary sense. <em>If he produces a painting</em>, then it is the painting which is the asset, not his ability to paint. Both can be ascribed a monetary value, but only the painting can be divided as a matrimonial asset in a divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As such, while it may be that the Husband’s Business was capable of being valued, in the sense that it is possible for someone (such as the accountant engaged by the Wife) to ascribe a value to this business undertaking, it did not necessarily follow that the Business was <em>ipso facto</em> a type divisible matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In support of her case, the Wife’s counsel cited the High Court (Family Division)’s decision in <em>XEB v XEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32323-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 37</a> (“<em>XEB</em>”) as an example of a case where the court had accepted a sole proprietorship as being an “asset”, and subsequently divided the same between the divorced parties. However, I did not understand the High Court’s judgment in <em>XEB</em> to stand for the legal proposition advanced by the Wife, <em>ie.</em> that a sole proprietorship was by its nature a divisible asset in divorce proceedings. Indeed, the nature of a sole proprietorship as a type of matrimonial asset was not an issue which arose in that case, nor did the High Court specifically discuss the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Moreover, it was not clear from the judgment whether the High Court’s reference to a “sole proprietorship” was a reference to specific assets and properties owned by the sole proprietorship in that case, or to the underlying business itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     If a sole proprietorship owned tangible and/or physical assets, it would not be controversial that these assets could be matrimonial assets capable of division. That, however, was not what the Wife sought to argue here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Goodwill and intangible properties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     To be clear, it is also uncontroversial that a business can own various types of <em>intangible</em> assets. Some common ones include intellectual property rights, digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies), or even choses in action (such as licensing rights, monies held in bank accounts, etc.). These are assets which <em>can</em> be sold, transferred, disposed-of and thus divisible between the divorcing parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     If a business owns these assets through an incorporated entity (such as a private limited company), then the value of these assets may be taken into account when valuing the shares in the incorporated entity. If such assets are owned by an unincorporated association (such as a sole proprietor), then these asset would have been held in the business owner’s own name and therefore divided as part of that person’s personal assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     “<em>Goodwill</em>” in a business is, arguably, a type of intangible asset since it is a form of property and is capable of being assigned: see <em>New Ping Ping Pauline v Eng’s Noodles House Pte Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/26592-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 4 SLR 1317</a> at [127]. For present purposes, I shall assume (without deciding) that a business’ goodwill is capable of being a matrimonial asset although I express some reservations as to how such goodwill may be “divided” in AM proceedings. For example, such an asset would not be capable of any <em>in specie</em> distribution unlike most other forms of matrimonial assets (such as cash, real property, or shares in a company). To avoid doubt, for reasons I will come to at [54(c)] below, the goodwill I am referring to here is the type of goodwill which is attached to (and synonymous with) the <em>business</em>, and not the proprietor running it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     On a related note, the Wife’s counsel referred in their written submissions, albeit briefly, to the existence of “<em>repeat clientele, and a proven capacity for profit</em>” as something owned by the Business in the present case.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> It was not clear whether the Wife was referring to something different from the goodwill of the Business. Be that as it may, no authority or precedent were cited to suggest that these would amount to independent assets of a sole proprietorship which are divisible in a divorce. In my view, these matters – by their nature – would not be capable of being treated as a freestanding asset belonging to the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Wife’s arguments, even if accepted, lacked evidential basis</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The upshot of the above discussion is that there remains some uncertainty as to whether a business (carried out as a sole proprietorship) is capable of being considered a freestanding asset divisible under s 112(10), WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Nevertheless, even if I was prepared (at least at a conceptual level) to accept that unincorporated businesses may themselves be divisible matrimonial assets so long as they comprise intangible assets (such as goodwill) which are independent from their proprietor’s personal assets and/or property, this would still not bring the Wife’s case very far on the facts of the present case. That is because the Wife had failed to show that the Business, <em>ie.</em> [EFVT], actually owned any such asset for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>First</u>, all the Wife had shown – through her accountant’s affidavit – was that the Business generated sales revenue, profits and loss in the past.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> However, these, in and of themselves, were not assets capable of being divided unless they were traceable to monies contained in the Business’ bank account (which have already been accounted for).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>Second</u>, despite making submissions on the relevance of “goodwill” in the Business, the Wife did not provide any actual professional and/or expert report which ascribed a <em>value</em> to the Business’ goodwill specifically. The Business’ estimated net profit was clearly not the same as its goodwill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Indeed, I was doubtful whether the Wife could point to what exactly was the so-called “goodwill” in question given the very nature of the Business (<em>ie.</em> the wholesale of vegetable and fruits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>). The Business had no registered intellectual property rights and/or branding, and there being no evidence to suggest that the Business’ brand or name was what was responsible for generating sales or revenue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The nature of the Husband’s Business was unlike the sort mentioned in the UK Tax Tribunal case of <em>Richard Villar v. The Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue &amp; Customs</em> [2019] UKFTT 117 (TC) (<em>“Richard Villar</em>”), a cited by the Wife’s counsel.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>Richard Villar</em>, the appellant doctor had sold his medical practice and the issue before the tax tribunal was whether the sale proceeds therefrom should be considered as a form of capital gain, or it should be considered as taxable income. In reaching its decision, the Tribunal found that Dr Villar had built a practice unlike that of many other surgeons, and that the name <em>“Richard Villar</em>” was capable of attracting customers notwithstanding the fact that not all medical services were provided by Dr Villar himself. There was thus goodwill in the <em>name</em> of the medical practice. That was <em>not</em> the situation in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_f\"></a>(f)     For completeness, I note that in some foreign jurisdictions, a distinction is drawn between the concept of “enterprise goodwill” (which attaches to an entity) and “personal goodwill” (which is associated with a person), with the latter not being capable of division in divorce proceedings.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_g\"></a>(g)      <u>Third</u>, the Wife had advanced a case where she characterised herself as was one of the two “bosses” who had built the Business;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> she was well acquainted with the Business having “<em>communicated with customers, suppliers, and the landlord, and personally handled the withdrawal and deposit of funds for business purposes</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This meant that any goodwill associated with the Business may well have vested in her as a form of personal goodwill. How then does one account for what she had brought to the Business over the years?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_h\"></a>(h)      <u>Fourth</u>, the fact that there was an alleged third-party who offered to “purchase” the Business in 2023 was, in my view, of little assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> The terms of this alleged offer were not put before the Court and it was unclear what this offer entailed? Did it include the assignment or transfer of rights/liabilities? Would there be any restrictive covenants which the Husband had to give, or was he required to provide his knowhow? These were all important considerations and factors which would affect what was being sold, and the price offered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_54-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In the absence of any concluded sale and purchase agreement, the Wife’s case that the existence of a previous offer meant that the sole proprietorship was itself an “asset” was too speculative</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     In the circumstances, I was not persuaded that a separate value should be ascribed to the Business, other than the Husband’s personal assets which were disclosed and which already formed part of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool (including the Business’ corporate bank account).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     To be clear, that does not mean that the Husband’s knowhow, and his ability to bring in sales and revenue in the fruit and vegetable wholesale business, were wholly irrelevant. These were matters which may be considered as part of the Wife’s maintenance claims, but they do not amount to an asset that was divisible in the parties’ divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Accordingly, my determination of the parties’ Matrimonial Pool is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 3 – Matrimonial Pool

to discuss the appropriate ratio of division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     In this regard, the Wife’s counsel submitted that the structured approach recognised in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> (<em>“ANJ</em> approach”) should be used as the Wife was an active income-earner during the marriage, having assisted with the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s counsel, on the other hand, submitted that the trends-based approach (based on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>TNL v TNK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/20138-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 1 SLR 609</a>) should be applied instead. The Husband argued that this was a long single-income marriage with him being the sole-breadwinner.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The present case was unusual in that throughout the marriage (which spanned some 21 years), most of the parties’ income, wealth and assets came from the Business. In the Husband’s written submissions, he asserted that the Wife was only working “part-time” in the earlier part of the marriage, prior to the birth of their child in 2011.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     Insofar as the Business was concerned, I found the following changes to its ownership and structure to be relevant to my assessment as to the nature of the marriage:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 19 November 2010, the Business was first registered <em>in the Wife’s</em> name only. This meant she was its sole proprietor at that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband was subsequently added as an owner on 4 May 2012. The Business thus became an unincorporated <em>partnership</em> between the two spouses, and continued to be so until 24 August 2016 when the Husband withdrew from the partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From that point, the Wife was, once again, the Business’ sole proprietor until 31 January 2021 when she too withdrew from the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, the Husband was then registered as its sole proprietor/owner on 1 February 2021, and continued to be its proprietor ever since.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The above information was clearly set out in the business profile search provided by the Wife. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span> In light of the above and for the reasons set out at [65] and [80] below, I found the present case to have been a dual-income marriage from 2003 to 2016.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In other words, for a period of 13 years (out of the parties’ 21 years of marriage), the Wife had been working. This included the period of 7 years (from 2003 to 2011) when she worked part-time (based on the Husband’s own submission).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     It may be that the parties had their own reasons as to why the Husband was added to and/or withdrawn from the Business over the same period, but given that the parties’ income and wealth came primarily from the Business, and that – in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary – the income from the Business would be attributable to its owner, I agree with the Wife that the <em>ANJ</em> approach ought to be used as the parties were both working and earning from the Business, during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The <em>ANJ</em> approach focuses on giving value to the financial and non-financial contributions made by each of the spouses towards the accumulation of marital wealth, as was the case here.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     I should add that the Wife’s description of her contributions to the Business in her affidavit,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> including providing accounting and manpower management support, was not challenged by the Husband (who elected <em>not</em> to file any reply affidavit).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     To recapitulate, under the <em>ANJ</em> approach, the Court undertakes the following analytical steps:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>first</em>, ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s <u>direct contributions</u> having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>second</em>, ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s <u>indirect contribution</u> to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>third</em>, using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court derives each party’s <u>average</u> percentage contribution to the family that would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_66-p2_d\"></a>(d)     make further adjustments (if needed) to the parties’ average percentage contributions to take into account <em>inter alia</em> any issues of adverse inference, or the other facts enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     As neither party had asked the Court to adopt any other methodology to classify the matrimonial assets, I used the “global assessment” methodology (as noted by the Court of Appeal in <em>NK v NL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0743.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743</a>) where a single division ratio applies to all of the parties’ matrimonial assets globally.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Financial Contribution Ratio </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     I will now address the ratio of the parties’ direct financial contribution (“DFC”) in the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In this regard, the Wife urged this Court to assign a 50:50 apportionment to the parties’ DFC. This was on account of her view that the “<em>parties’ assets are all acquired using the</em> [Business’] <em>monies”.</em> I did not agree with her argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     For reasons personal to themselves, the parties chose to have certain assets vested in each of their own names during the marriage. There was no clear evidence as to which asset was purchased by which spouse during which period of the marriage. The Wife acknowledged, in her own affidavit, that the Husband had kept the cash profit from the business. This would include the periods when she was the registered sole proprietor or partner of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     In my view, it would not be appropriate for the Wife – having herself advocated the use of the <em>ANJ</em> approach – to then seek a determination of the parties’ DFC ratio through the use of broad-based assertions which disregarded the <em>actual</em> direct contributions or payments each party had made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Accordingly, each party’s sole-named assets (such as bank account/CPF monies, etc.) would be used as a proxy for his or her respective direct contributions to the marriage: see <em>WFE v WFF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/30302-SSP.xml')\">[2023] 1 SLR 1524</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     As regards the Matrimonial Flat, it was undisputed that the said property was fully paid up through monies from the parties’ CPF accounts and in cash. The parties’ respective CPF-based payments and/or transfers towards the acquisition of the Matrimonial Flat were set out in the Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> and these were <em>not</em> challenged by the Wife in her reply affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     With regard to the parties’ cash contributions, I agreed with the Wife that, in the absence of any clear evidence provided by the Husband, the cash payments over the years – amounting to $152,404.15 – would have been paid out from the profits of the Business. Given that the Wife remained an owner of the Business at the material time, this amount should be apportioned equally between the two spouses in recognition of the work she would have done for the Business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     Overall, the parties’ direct contributions to the Matrimonial Flat would be as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a></p><div align=\"center\"> <b><u>Table 4 – Matrimonial Flat</u></b> </div><p></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"29.1741651669666%\"><col width=\"22.9154169166167%\"><col width=\"20.8358328334333%\"><col width=\"27.0745850829834%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Asset</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Remarks</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF Monies</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$207,675.85 </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$59,920.00</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">DA1 at [9] and [21]</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cash</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$76,202.08</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$76,202.07</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$152,404.15, apportioned 50:50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Sub-total</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$283,877.93</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$136,122.07</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total purchase price of $420,000</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Ratio</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>67.59%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>32.41%</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"middle\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>This ratio would then be used to apportion the Matrimonial Flat’s current value (of $605,000) between the spouses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In ascertaining the parties’ contributions paid using CPF monies, I used the <em>principal</em> amount withdrawn, and not the total refundable amount.

id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     Having determined the parties’ DFC, I now move on to consider their indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect Contribution Ratio (“IDC”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     When determining the parties’ IDC, the case law is clear that the Court does “<em>not</em> [indulge] <em>in a rigid and mechanistic calculation exercise</em>” and would instead adopt what is often referred to as a “broad-brush” approach.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> This means that the Court focuses on “<em>broad factual indicators such as the length of the marriage, the number of children, and which party was the children’s primary caregiver</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> rather than going into the minute aspects of the parties’ family life.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> This is especially so given that the parties’ marriage here spanned more than 2 decades.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     In broad terms, I accepted the Wife’s claim that the parties’ respective roles were that the Husband would be the principal (although not sole) breadwinner through his knowledge and expertise in the fruit and vegetable wholesale industry. The main business vehicle they had used to earn the family’s income is the Business. The Wife, on the other hand, took on more home-making and childcare responsibilities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> while continuing to provide accounting, manpower and customer-related support services in furtherance of the Business.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> This was the arrangement for a significant period of the marriage up until 2023 (which was after the breakdown of the marriage due to the Wife’s discovery of the Husband’s latest extra-marital affair).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     Overall, while the Husband’s indirect contributions were mainly financial in nature, the Wife made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions. I also took into account the Wife’s contributions and efforts in conceiving (through difficult procedures such as <em>in-vitro</em> fertilisation),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> raising, and caring for their daughter, [E].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     For completeness, I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the Husband’s conduct had risen to the level where a <em>negative</em> contribution value ought to be ascribed to him. The precedents cited by her counsel – such as <em>Chan Tin Sun v Fong Quay Sim</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17048-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 2 SLR 195</a> – involved far more egregious conduct. The Wife’s own submissions recognised the high bar before a negative contribution would be ascribed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span> I found that the Wife’s allegations, founded on the Husband’s philandering and other behaviour, did not meet the requisite threshold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     However, I did not disregard the Wife’s steadfast and stoic tolerance of the Husband’s unsavoury behaviour, and her continued care of the home and their child in difficult circumstances. Instead, I factored these considerations in when assessing the appropriate IDC ratio.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     Overall, adopting a broad-brush approach, I found it reasonable to ascribe an indirect contribution ratio of 70:30, in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adverse Inference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     I move on now to the issue of adverse inference. The Wife submitted that a 5% adjustment (or “uplift”) should be made to account for the adverse inference which should be drawn against the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Wife’s main point was that the Husband had been less than candid with his assets, and had concealed the true extent of his wealth. According to the Wife, the Husband’s claim that he was merely an <em>employee</em> of one [JS] Pte Ltd (“JSPL”) should not be believed, and that, in truth, he was using JSPL as a means to divert matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> Her assertions and claims were set out in her counsel’s written submissions. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     I agreed with the Wife’s counsel that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband. In addition to the points raised in the Wife’s submissions (which I broadly accepted), I make the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the overall tenor of the Husband’s case (and arguments he advanced) to be inconsistent with what the evidence showed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     While the Husband claimed to be a vegetable seller (earning an income of $2,500 per month) and a delivery driver (earning another $1,400 per month), I agreed with the Wife that his expenditures and the amount of money he had deposited into his bank accounts were not consonant with a person earning only $3,900 per month. Despite the alleged modest income, the Husband was able to purchase and drive a car (of a luxury make and model), purchase expensive luxury watches, and indeed, fully paid off his property several years after its purchase, while at the same time, claimed to be main person responsible for paying all of the family’s finances. None of these would have been possible if he had only earned $3,900 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     More importantly, it was highly suspicious that his alleged employer, JSPL, was wholly owned by one [WY],<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> whom the Wife alleged that [WY] was the Husband’s romantic partner. What was more concerning (and telling) was that the documents showed that [WY] <em>was also the Husband’s employee.</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s affidavit disclosed CPF records showing the Business paying CPF contributions for its “employees”, one of whom was [WY].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_d\"></a>(d)     This entire corporate structure/arrangement was thus highly suspicious to say the least. Moreover, the monetary transactions between the Husband and JSPL were also highly questionable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_e\"></a>(e)     For example, the Husband received a sum of $15,000 on 29 April 2024 which he claimed to be payment for the supply of vegetables to his client.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> But this so-called “client” was shown to be JSPL, which the Husband declared was his alleged <em>employer</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_f\"></a>(f)     How did the Husband’s employer end up becoming his client? The Husband failed to provide any clear explanation for this highly anomalous situation. Moreover, JSPL’s listed business activities in its business registration were for “<em>general cleaning services</em>” which would have ostensibly nothing to do with the Husband’s Business, involving the supply and purchase of vegetables.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_g\"></a>(g)     All these suspicious circumstances and transactions put together supported the Wife’s claim that there was a <em>prima facie</em> case of concealment of assets for which the Husband did not provide any reasonable justification for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     I therefore found that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the Husband, and would thus include a 5% uplift (under the uplift method recognised in <em>UZN v UZM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25771-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 1 SLR 426</a>) in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     For completeness, 5% of the parties’ matrimonial assets amount to approximately $49,000. This sum was approximately equivalent to 1 year of the Husband’s declared salary of $3,900 per month. I found this to be a reasonable estimate of the amount which would have been concealed by the Husband between 2023 (when the Wife remained involved, albeit tangentially with the Business,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span> and the IJ date of 7 February 2024)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     In the circumstances,

70% of the parties’ total assets. Although I did not award her that proportion, I nevertheless gave her an opportunity to retain the property upon payment of the Husband’s share of the assets by making the appropriate orders for her to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance for the Wife and Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     I now move on to the next area of contention, <em>ie.</em> whether the Wife was entitled to claim from the Husband maintenance for herself, post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     In this regard, it is trite law that the power to order maintenance for an ex-wife is supplementary to the division of the parties’ matrimonial assets,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span> and the Court will consider how much each party will receive from the division of their matrimonial assets as one relevant factor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     In the present case, the Wife would be receiving a significant proportion (approx. 56%) of the parties’ matrimonial assets under my division orders. It was also not disputed that the Wife was gainfully employed as an office worker earning a salary of approx. $1,550.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     While this amount appears low compared to the standard of living which she was accustomed to during the marriage, it is well established law that a post-divorce maintenance order is not meant to provide a “meal ticket for life” nor should it create a life-long dependency.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> Ultimately, the Wife is expected to exert herself, and to earn as much as reasonably possible.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> It was for this reason that I did not accept the Wife’s argument that the appropriate maintenance order in the present case should be “<em>forward-looking, calibrated to ensure the wife’s long-term financial security…</em>”, nor should the order provide a “<em>buffer for retirement planning and contingencies</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> These factors were, in my view, <em><u>not</u></em> the purpose of a post-divorce maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     Overall, I found it appropriate to order the Husband to provide a sum of $500 per month for a period of 3 years (or $18,000 in total).

expenses, the focus was on the appropriate budget to be provided: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [10] and [46].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Further, in <em>WOS v WOT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30067-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 36</a> (at [50] of its judgment), the High Court (Family Division) aptly noted as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">50    In my view, <b>a child’s reasonable needs are not determined solely by the financial capabilities of its parents</b>. The focus of the enquiry should be on whether the expense itself is needed for each child. <b>Although wealthy parents may indulge their children beyond what they reasonably need, they can expend the largesse at their pleasure</b>. The court is only concerned with what a child in the circumstances reasonably needs. In this connection, the full expenses of a tertiary education at an overseas institution are not reasonable expenses that parents should be mandated to pay for — simply on the basis that they can afford it. Instead, they are luxury expenses that parents can choose to indulge their children in. A much more reasonable expense is the costs related to tertiary education at a local university or a portion thereof. Furthermore, there is no reason why children who wish to pursue an overseas education cannot take on some responsibility for their decision, for instance by either off-setting some of their unnecessary expenses, obtaining scholarships, grants, and student loans, or contributing to their own expenses by working part-time. Children should not simply expect their parents to provide for every desire.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\">[Emphasis added in <b>bold</b>]</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    Accordingly, when considering [E]’s expenses, I made the following adjustments to the Wife’s claim:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I found the amounts provisioned by the Wife for [E]’s school allowance, eating out, public transport, and clothing to be very high, and possibly duplicative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_b\"></a>(b)     For example, school allowance at $440 per month would translate to $22 per school day (<em>ie.</em> 5 school days a week) for a 11-year-old child. Yet, there was an <em>additional amount</em> of $500 per month provisioned for “eating out”. I thus scaled down these expenses to what would be reasonable amounts having regard to [E]’s age and needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_c\"></a>(c)     [E]’s transport costs were similarly exorbitant. The claim of $100 per month puts her costs at the same quantum as the Wife’s own transport claim. It was apparent from the Wife’s own summary, that her claim was for “<em>Public transport (Ez-link/SimplyGo)</em>”. These were references to the stored value and/or transport cards used for public trains and buses in Singapore. However, as a school student, [E] would be eligible for concession fares on these modes of transportation. These would cost a fraction of what the Wife has claimed. There was no reason why the Wife should not take steps to use these cheaper means of transportation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I move on to the claim for Tuition classes, which represented the largest claim by quantum (<em>ie.</em> $1,580 per month). The Wife, in her counsel’s submissions, argued that [E]’s expenses were “<em>supported by itemised tables and receipts</em>”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> That, in itself, meant little. As the High Court (Family Division) held in <em>WBU v WBT</em> [2023] SGHCF, “[t]<em>he mere fact that the parties have been paying for certain items during the marriage does not automatically render such expenses reasonable expenses for the purposes of determining maintenance.</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_e\"></a>(e)     I was not persuaded that the Wife had justified these tuition expenses. There was no evidence provided as to [E]’s grades in school, any report on how she was doing, and whether she required tuition to help with her learning and development objectives. It was not enough to simply claim that there were tuition expenses. The <em>need</em> for these expenses had to be established. Moreover, even based on the actual payment vouchers exhibited, it was not clear that entire sum of $1,580 <em>per month</em> had been shown to be incurred.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span> For example, the Math, English and Chinese tuition classes for May 2024 added up to only $670 based on the receipts provided. That was significantly less than the amount claimed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Overall, I allocated a <em>budget</em> of $500 per month, which the Wife (as the care parent) could make use of to match and assess [E]’s educational needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_105-p2_g\"></a>(g)     Finally, for holiday expenses, I found this item to be a purely item of luxury given that it was meant to be holidays to visit the Wife’s family members in Malaysia. Moreover, a sum of $400 <em>per month</em> was clearly an excessive amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    Overall, I found [E]’s reasonable expenses (including her share of the household expenditure) to be approximately $2,000 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    I thus ordered the Husband to contribute a sum of <u>$1,600 per month</u> as the [E]’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    In reaching this amount, I took into account the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I did not accept that the Husband’s actual monthly income and earning capacity to be only $3,900 as he had alleged. For the reasons set out above, I found that he was able to earn at least <em>twice</em> that amount from the Business (including the control and influence he wields over JSPL). I had alluded to the Husband’s earning capacity and his know-how and abilities at [56] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_108-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This meant that his income/earning capacity would make up approximately 80% of the parties’ combined income. I thus found it reasonable to apportion [E]’s expenses in proportion to the parties’ income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    Finally, I decided not to make any orders in relation to the reimbursement of [E]’s medical fees or for a blanket order relating to her future university education. I found neither to be necessary at this stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    I had already provisioned a monthly budget for medical and dental expenses. There was no evidence that [E] suffered from any specific long-term or special medical condition which necessitated an <em>ad hoc</em> medical expenses reimbursement order. As for university education, I found that claim to be wholly speculative at the present juncture. There is still almost one decade more before [E] enters university, and that is a matter which can be addressed through subsequent applications, if the need arises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    In the premises, I set out below a summary of my final AM orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of Matrimonial Flat</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I gave the Wife the option to acquire the Husband’s share of the parties’ Matrimonial Flat by giving him written notice within 1 month from the date of my order. If the Wife chose to do so, she should pay the Husband an amount of $169,939.81 (equivalent to 28% of the market value of the Matrimonial Flat), and the Husband would have to transfer her his interests in the Matrimonial Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Alternatively, if the Wife elected not to purchase the Husband’s share, then the parties shall have joint conduct of the sale of the Matrimonial Flat in the open market within 6 months from the date of the Certificate of Final Judgment, at or above the sale price of $605,000, (or such other price as the parties may agree in writing).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The proceeds of sale of the Matrimonial Flat should then be divided in the proportion of 72 (Wife): 28 (Husband), after paying all the relevant payments, costs and expenses required by the relevant authorities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_d\"></a>(d)     I also included additional orders to address the parties’ obligation to make refunds to their CPF accounts, and what to do if there were shortfall in the amount refunded, or where one party receives more refunds than what he or she was entitled to under the division order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Division of Other Matrimonial Assets</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Each party shall retain all the other assets in their sole name and possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Maintenance for the Plaintiff</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband must pay to the Wife lump-sum maintenance in the sum of $18,000. I gave the Husband the option of paying this amount in $500 monthly instalments for a period of 36 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Maintenance for the Child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Husband shall pay to the Wife maintenance for the child of the marriage, [E], in the sum of $1,600 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Other Orders</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_111-p2_h\"></a>(h)     I also included a Registrar’s empowerment clause to allow the Registrar and/or Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts to execute or sign documents should either party fail to do.

Even up to this point, the Father has refused to disclose the whereabouts of the children. Upon my query, the Father’s counsel clarified that prayer 1 is an application for stay of proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> and that neither prayer 1 nor prayer 2, if granted, would lead to a dismissal of the Mother’s application as sought in prayer 3. In light of the Father’s clarifications, there were in substance two applications to be determined.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The first was prayer 2, which was the Father’s application to set aside the service of the court papers on the ground that he was out of jurisdiction when the substituted service was effected. This was dealt with as a preliminary issue and parties agreed that it would be helpful to obtain from the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (“ICA”) the entry and exit records of the Father and the two children from April 2025 to May 2025, which counsel for the Father helpfully facilitated. To save time and costs, parties also agreed for the ICA’s reply to be tendered to court via correspondence without the need for the Father to file an affidavit exhibiting the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The second was prayer 1, which was the Father’s application to stay the proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I heard the applications sequentially and dismissed both prayers with costs fixed at $3,000 to the Mother. As the Father has appealed against part of my decision <em>vide</em> HCF/RAS 26/2025 filed on 2 September 2025, I now provide my written grounds of decision incorporating my brief grounds with elaborations where required.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application to set aside service of process</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father says that when the court papers were served on 7 May 2025 by way of substituted service in Singapore, he was physically present in China.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> The Father submits that where a respondent is outside of Singapore, service must be effected by way of service out of Singapore, and leave of court must be sought for such service.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> As no leave was obtained, the substituted service effected in Singapore was defective and invalid.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> The Father further contends that the substituted service by way of Singpass contravened the laws and public policy of China<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span> and is hence contrary to P.7, r.11(6) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“FJGR”), which provides that “[n]othing is to be done under this Rule that is contrary to the laws of the foreign country”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> Citing the case authority of <em>Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd (in compulsory liquidation) v P T Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi TBK and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17427-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 144</a>, the Father asserts that substituted service is only allowed if it does not contravene the law of the foreign jurisdiction.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I was not persuaded by the Father’s arguments that the substituted service was defective because it was effected on a day when he was out of Singapore. It is an established principle that the effect of substituted service carried out pursuant to an order of court is equivalent for all purposes to actual service. The document will be regarded as being properly served: see <em>Singapore Court Practice (Lexis Nexis)</em> at [7.7.9] and <em>Singapore Rules of Court – A Practice Guide</em> (Academy Publishing, 2023) at [07.038].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In my judgment, it is immaterial that the Father was not in Singapore when the substituted service was effected. To challenge the validity of the service, the Father would have to challenge the validity of the order for substituted service itself. Hence, the issue, correctly framed, is whether there are grounds to set aside the order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Where a respondent had left Singapore before the originating process was issued, a claimant would have to first seek permission to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction before resorting to substituted service: see <em>Consistel Pte Ltd and another v Farooq Nasir and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/61546-M.xml')\">[2009] SGHC 82</a> (at [30]) (“<em>Consistel</em>”). As noted in <em>Consistel</em> (at [35]), this general rule is subject to at least two exceptions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Of course, the principle stated in [30] above is a general rule to which there are exceptions. One clear exception mentioned earlier is where the defendant leaves the country in anticipation that legal proceedings will be initiated against him. In such a situation, substituted service would be warranted. Another exception is when a defendant is constantly moving from country to country such that it is impossible to serve the writ on him personally. In such a case, there is no need to apply for personal service out of jurisdiction since any attempt at personal service clearly will be futile. Substituted service will suffice. There may be other exceptions but it would be unwise to speculate. Even so, these exceptions do not detract from the force of the general principle that applying for personal service out of jurisdiction should be the first port of call for plaintiffs who have to serve a writ on defendants who are outside Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In the present case, it was unnecessary for me to consider whether the exceptions to the general rule apply. This is because I was of the view that there was no requirement for the Mother to seek permission to serve the originating process out of jurisdiction to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As explained in my brief grounds, there is no evidence to suggest that the Father had left Singapore permanently before the OAG proceedings were initiated against him on 14 April 2025. On the other hand, there is ample evidence to support the Mother’s claim that the Father is ordinarily resident in Singapore. This is further corroborated by the ICA records, which show that the Father was in Singapore on 14 April 2025 when the OAG proceedings were initiated, and had made multiple trips in and out of Singapore from 15 April 2025 to 31 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The fact that the Father happened to be out of Singapore on the day that the substituted service was effected was purely fortuitous. It does not change the fact that he ordinarily resides in Singapore. That position remained unchanged even when the order for substituted service was made on 2 May 2025. There is no basis as such to set aside the order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It follows that P.7, r.11(6) of the FJGR also does not apply, since the originating process was served <em>within</em> jurisdiction <em>via</em> a valid order for substituted service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     For the above reasons, I dismissed prayer 2 of SUM 1244.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Having dealt with prayer 2, I turn now to prayer 1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application for stay</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Although prayer 1 was framed as a declaration that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the present proceedings, counsel for the Father clarified that the Father is seeking a stay of the proceedings on the ground of <em>foreign non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     It is trite that under stage 1 of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, the burden rests on the party seeking the stay to show that there is another available forum that is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to determine the dispute. In determining which forum is more appropriate, the court takes into consideration various connecting factors, the weight of which varies with each factual matrix. A factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might not be that important in another: see <em>AZS v AZR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0102.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 102</a> (at [11(a)]) and <em>BDA v BDB</em> 1 SLR 607 (“<em>BDA v BDB</em>”) (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Where the stay application relates to proceedings involving the custody of a child, the application of the welfare principle requires the court to examine which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the child. In the seminal decision of the Family Division in <em>TDX v TDY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16809-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 4</a> (“<em>TDX v TDY</em>”), Debbie Ong JC (as she then was) observed (at [15]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In my view, the application of the welfare principle in a case such as the present involves the proper application of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em>, which would in turn require the court to examine which jurisdiction is better placed to decide on the issues concerning the welfare of the child. Support for this view can be found in the decision of <em>Re A (an infant)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0570.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 570</a> (“<em>Re A</em>”), in which Lai Kew Chai J referred to the decision of the House of Lords in <em>De Dampierre v De Dampierre</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68561-E-M.xml')\">[1988] AC 92</a> (“<em>De Dampierre</em>”), which was a case where the <em>Spiliada</em> principles were applied to matrimonial proceedings. The learned judge considered at [4] that when applying <em>De Dampierre</em> and the <em>Spiliada</em> principles to issues relating to a child, the central question is which forum would more effectively evaluate the best interests of the child …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As noted by the learned judge, the court has to take into account a host of factors in order to identify the forum that is better equipped to determine the child’s best interests.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> The relevance and weight of the factors must be decided in the light of the welfare of the child. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Habitual residence of the child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     One of the factors is the habitual residence of the child. This was a key plank of the Father’s case<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> that merited some attention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     As noted in <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [27]), the habitual residence of the child is a relevant consideration in deciding which forum is more appropriate to decide on the issues concerning a child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span> The learned judge explained (at [33]) as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court of the child’s habitual residence is likely to have a close affinity with and good understanding of the child’s cultural background, value systems, social norms and other societal circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The habitual residence of the child both at the time of removal or retention and at the time of proceedings is relevant: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [34]). The habitual residence is not necessarily equivalent to domicile, citizenship or nationality, but is the country to which the child is closely connected, having lived in it for some time and integrated into its community and culture. The child’s habitual residence is one of factors to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of the particular case: see <em>TDX v TDY</em> (at [37], [38] &amp; [45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     To determine the child’s habitual residence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">… the court will have to consider where the child has been living and how settled she is in that country, including how integrated she is to the country in terms of the environment, education system, culture, language and people around her in that country. The court will also have to consider where her parents are habitually resident and whether one or both parents had the intention that the child should reside there.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In the supporting affidavit, the Father averred as follows:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The children are presently habitually resident in China and are enrolled in school there. There have no legal status, domicile, or habitual residence in Singapore. The children are not even in Singapore at the moment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Apart from the bare assertion that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”, the Father did not provide any detail to substantiate his claim. In my view, this omission is glaring because the evidential burden of proof lies with the Father to prove that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”: see s 105 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed). The Father did not provide any evidence as to when the children were taken out of Singapore, let alone how well they have integrated back in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Furthermore, the Father’s claim that the children are “presently habitually resident in China” is contradicted by the ICA records, which show that the children were present in Singapore throughout most of April and May 2025. In fact, I found the Father’s claim that “the children are not even in Singapore at the moment” to be rather misleading, as the ICA records show that the children were in Singapore on 31 May 2025, the same day that the Father affirmed his supporting affidavit in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Further, the immigration records from the Chinese authorities dated 9 June 2025 also contradicted the Father’s claim. The records show that the children returned from China to Singapore on 1 February 2025 and had not returned to China since.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     There is also no evidence from the Father to shed light on the circumstances leading to the children being relocated back to China, whether he has obtained the consent of the Mother to relocate them and the whereabouts of the children. These are basic facts that the court would need to make a proper assessment of the children’s habitual residence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In the absence of such evidence, I was left with the Mother’s evidence which shows that sometime in August 2023, the Father proposed for the children and the Mother to relocate to Singapore from China so that the children could benefit from an education in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> The family relocated to Singapore sometime in 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> From August 2023 to February 2024, the children were studying at [School A]<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> and in August 2024, the children were studying at [School B].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> The Mother also produced evidence to show that the children were in attendance at the school’s events and activities as recent as May 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span> and that they were still enrolled in [School B] as at 5 June 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span> The Mother also averred that she did not know about or consent to the Father removing the children from Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     As it stood, there was simply insufficient evidence to substantiate the Father’s claim that the children are “presently habitually resident in China”. On the contrary, the available evidence pointed to the children being habitually resident in Singapore as at the date of his application to stay the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Consequently, the habitual residence of the children did not favour a stay of the proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Public interest and res judicata<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Father submits that the dispute has already been adjudicated in China and it is not in the public interest of Singapore to permit re-litigation of a matter already determined by a competent foreign court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Father says that the parties have already resolved the same dispute in China. On 9 July 2024, they entered into a mediation agreement in China, which was converted into a court order. The agreement granted the Mother rights of access to the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> On 14 August 2024, the Mother commenced enforcement proceedings in China claiming that he had failed to comply with the mediation order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> On 20 March 2025, the Chinese court ruled that he had fulfilled his legal obligations in compliance with the mediation order and the Mother’s enforcement application was dismissed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The Father submits that continued proceedings in Singapore will give rise to a multiplicity of proceedings and a real risk of conflicting judgments.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span> It would not be in the children’s welfare to have two sets of proceedings and orders on care and control.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> There is also a risk that continuing with OAG 74 would offend international comity.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Father’s claim is disputed by the Mother who asserts that the Chinese court did not make any determination as to whether the mediation agreement had been breached. As a matter of procedural formality, the matter was closed as the enforcement suit had remained pending for more than 6 months and the trial period had expired.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In my judgment, the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> is inapplicable. As discussed in Debbie Ong, <em>International Issues in Family Law in Singapore</em> (Academy Publishing, 2015) at page 244:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Custody disputes are unique because the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. It is not surprising that despite a prior foreign custody order, the court, guided by the welfare principle, may be willing to re-open a custody dispute and determine the case on its merits. The Privy Council, in <em>Mark T Mckee V Evelyn McKee</em>, a case on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada, had held years ago that it is the negation of the welfare principle not to enter into the merits of the question afresh, even where there is a foreign order in existence. Lord Simonds held:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">But it is the negation of the proposition, from which every judgment in this case has proceeded, namely, that the infant’s welfare is the paramount consideration, to say that where the trial judge has in his discretion thought fit … to examine all the circumstances and form an independent judgment, his decision ought for that reason to be overruled. Once it is conceded that the court of Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the question of custody and that it need not blindly follow an order made by a foreign court, the consequence cannot be escaped that it must form an independent judgment on the question, though in dong so it will give proper weight to the foreign judgment. What is the proper weight will depend on the circumstances of each case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     It is clear from the above passage that the Singapore court is not bound by a prior foreign custody order as it is required under the welfare principle to examine the merits of the case afresh. Hence, even if the dispute had been adjudicated in China, the Father’s arguments, premised on the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>, could not succeed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Moreover, family circumstances involving children can change over time. Unlike final civil judgments, custody orders are not final and conclusive in the strict sense as they are subject to variation when there has been a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child. It is clear from the available evidence that circumstances have changed since the mediated agreement, which necessitates a review of the custody and access arrangements. As such, the Mother’s application in OAG 74 is not a re-litigation, nor does it offend the principle of international comity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As noted earlier, a key plank of the Father’s case is that the children are habitually resident in China. However, the Father’s supporting affidavit is not only devoid of material particulars, but is also misleading. In his written submissions, he emphasised that the children are “physically present in China during these proceedings”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>, but that in turn begs the question of how they came to be there when there was an injunction restraining him from removing the children from Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I also found no merit in the Father’s submissions premised on public policy and the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em>. Indeed, it is troubling that the Father has refused to disclose the whereabouts of the children,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span> thereby effectively cutting off the Mother’s access to them. Clearly, there are compelling reasons to review the custody and access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Balancing all factors, I found that the Father has not discharged the burden of showing that China is clearly or distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore. In the circumstances, there was no necessity to proceed to stage two of the <em>Spiliada</em> test: <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [34].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For the above

before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       SSP 858/2025 (“SSP 858”) was the Wife’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against her Husband. She alleged that the Husband had hurt her in an incident that had occurred on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February 2025. She claimed that her cutlery had gone missing. When she went to confront her Husband, who was in his room, he slammed the door shut against her fingers. She then decided to gather her cutlery for safekeeping. There was an altercation between herself and the Husband – she says he tried to snatch the cutlery from her, and in so doing, cut her thigh and broke her fingernails.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Apart from this incident, the Wife also accused the Husband of harassing her. For instance, she said that he would leave the house in a mess. She also pointed to various arguments they had over the splitting of household bills. Finally, she accused the Husband of stealing her jewellery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       SSP 1143/2025 (“SSP 1143”) was the Husband’s application. He sought a PPO, as well as a Domestic Exclusion Order (“DEO”) and a Stay-Away Order (“SAO”) against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Husband says that the Wife had inflicted physical abuse, as well as emotional and/or psychological abuse on him. He points to the same incident the Wife had relied on (above at [2]) where the both of them had fought over cutlery. He says that the Wife had confronted him about the missing cutlery in the corridor of their flat. He tried to move past her and brushed her aside. She punched him in the chest. The Husband also says that the Wife had threatened to “bring him down using the Women’s Charter” and began hitting herself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In addition to this incident, the Husband also accuses the Wife of, amongst other things, falsely accusing him of physically assaulting her, stealing his personal belongings such as his Gucci slippers and sensitive documents, and tampering with his workstation. The Husband also accuses the Wife of using his toothbrush to clean the toilet bowl – he says he had discovered the toothbrush with strands of hair and dirt on it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I heard the trial of both matters on 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2025. After hearing oral submissions from parties, I dismissed both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The law makes it clear that to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that there had been family violence committed, or that it was likely that family violence would be committed: Section 60A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (the “Charter”). An applicant must also show that it would be necessary to make such an order for their protection and personal safety: Section 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Parties in the present case once shared their lives together. They were married. Their marriage has not worked out. Divorce proceedings were initiated and concluded. Final judgment was obtained. The Husband and Wife had both indicated their desire to go their own separate ways.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There was, however, one final thread holding them together – and that was the matrimonial flat. It was apparent to me from their evidence, as well as the allegations that each of them had brought against the other, that the main cause of their conflict was because they both continued to share a common space, which provided ample fuel for their continued dispute and discontent towards each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That being said, this final thread holding the both of them together was about to be severed. The house was about to be sold pursuant to the court order. That order provided that the flat was to be sold within six months after the date of the final judgment (which was extracted on 11 July 2025). Property agents had been engaged to facilitate the sale within the parameters set by the court order. Both the Husband and the Wife had also given evidence of their intention to go their own separate ways after the flat had been sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Given this, it was apparent to me that neither party had established the necessity of ordering a PPO. As a result, both their applications must fail. Further, and because I have not granted the Husband’s application for a PPO, his application for a DEO and SAO must also fail: see Section 60B(1) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I therefore dismissed both SSP 858 and SSP 1143.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Whether a parent neglects to pay child maintenance where he has no knowledge of being the biological parent","Family Law – Maintenance – The applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn in trials on child maintenance","Family Law – Maintenance – Which parent should bear the cost of paternity test"],"date":"2025-10-10","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS 750/2024","title":"XSR v XSS","citation":"[2025] SGFC 108","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33946-SSP.xml","counsel":["Wang Liansheng and Petrina Tan (Bih Li & Lee LLP) for the applicant","Lim Fung Peen, Samantha Ee and Chua Hong Hui (Yuen Law LLC) for the respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-10-15T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Teh Joo Lin","html":"<root><head><title>XSR v XSS</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSR <em>v</em> XSS </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33946-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 108</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">MSS 750/2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">10 October 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Teh Joo Lin </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Wang Liansheng and Petrina Tan (Bih Li &amp; Lee LLP) for the applicant; Lim Fung Peen, Samantha Ee and Chua Hong Hui (Yuen Law LLC) for the respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XSR — XSS </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Whether a parent neglects to pay child maintenance where he has no knowledge of being the biological parent</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">The applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn in trials on child maintenance</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Which parent should bear the cost of paternity test</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">10 October 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Teh Joo Lin:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This was an application for child maintenance under s 69(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961. A unique feature of this matter lay in the applicant’s pursuit of the fullest possible extent of backdated maintenance for the two children, despite the respondent’s assertions that he had no knowledge of being their biological father until <em>after</em> a paternity test – commissioned after the commencement of the child maintenance proceedings – put the issue to bed. The issue of the respondent’s prior knowledge was therefore relevant to the question of just <em>when</em> his neglect to provide reasonable maintenance for the children properly arose, and in any event, whether on the facts of the case, the Court ought to order maintenance for the children on a backdated basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Brief Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I first set out some brief facts. The applicant worked as a regional sales manager. The respondent was a businessman who ran corporate interests in Singapore and Malaysia, and who was married with two children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The applicant had started working in the respondent’s company in 2011. In the subsequent years, the parties had a relationship. During this period, the applicant gave birth to two children, who were born in Oct 2016 and May 2022 (“the children”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties’ relationship ended in 2023. It was undisputed that the applicant left the respondent’s company in June 2023, although their accounts differed as to why – he said it was because she had diverted business away. She said it was because of her finding out about his affair with another colleague.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In February 2024, it was alleged that the applicant contacted the respondent’s wife, informing her that she had had two children with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 28 March 2024, the applicant commenced her application for child maintenance for the two children. To clarify the issue of paternity, the parties underwent paternity testing, which confirmed on 23 August 2024 that the respondent was the biological father of both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The matter went through a somewhat lengthy pre-trial stage involving discussions over the paternity testing and several rounds of voluntary disclosure. By the time of the trial, the key issue to be addressed pertained only to whether an order of maintenance should be made and if so, the nature of that order. In this regard, the applicant had sought the maximum amount of backdated maintenance in relation to both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Another issue was on reimbursement for the cost of the paternity testing. The applicant’s position was for the respondent to bear the entire cost of the paternity test as he had challenged paternity in the first place. On the other hand, the respondent sought for the costs to be shared regardless of the outcome, on the basis that both parties equally required the results.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Children’s Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I started with the issue of maintenance for the children. The applicant sought $6,000 per month as maintenance for both children. Further, she sought for the Court to backdate the maintenance payments: for the elder child (“the daughter”), the backdating was to start from 1 April 2021, being the maximum period of three years prior to the time of the application; for the younger child (“the son”), the backdating was to start from May 2022, being the period from the son’s birth to the time of application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The respondent did not dispute that he should pay maintenance. However, his final proposal was to pay $2,517.34 to $2,936.89 a month for the children, and for the backdating to start only from March 2024, when the application was filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The relevant provision, being section 69(2) of the Women’s Charter, provides that the Court may make an order for reasonable maintenance where there is due proof that a respondent had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for a child. In making such an order, the Court must first be satisfied that the applicant has discharged the burden of proving that the respondent has neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the child. To determine if this legal threshold is satisfied, the Court must first determine what the monetary amount of “reasonable maintenance” is, on the facts of the case. The Court takes a “practical approach” to assess if the parties had reasonably provided such maintenance (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [44]-[45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Leaving aside my consideration of the parties’ respective means and incomes for the time being, I considered:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The amount that would constitute reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether there was neglect or refusal to provide such reasonable maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The amount

The applicant’s counsel submitted that this was “commonly known as the <em>Browne v Dunn</em> rule”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The rule in <em>Browne and Dunn</em> (1893) 6 R 67 is a common rule of evidence from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. It was true that the respondent’s counsel had not cross-examined the applicant on her estimated figures for most of the line items in her list of expenses, and of the estimates pertaining to the children’s expenses. However, this did not lead to the ineluctable conclusion that the applicant’s estimates should be adopted by the Court as incontrovertible. Ultimately, the Court must come to its own view on what was a reasonable expense for each line item, based on all the circumstances. In a related vein, it is trite that even if the applicant’s expenses were undisputed, or proven to be actual expenses, this did not <em>ipso facto</em> mean that they were necessarily reasonable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In any event, the rule in <em>Browne v Dunn</em> is rooted in fairness at trial. The stringency of application must surely depend on the context. This case occurred in the context of maintenance – specifically, during the exercise of ascertaining the monthly expenses based on parties’ reasonable estimates of various line items. In this context, there had been joinder in relation to most of the line items; the issue was what the value for each line item should be. The aim of the exercise was to assist the Court in ascertaining the reasonable expense to be assigned to a given line item, and it was clear to all concerned that both parties had come to trial with their respective estimates, of which some were accepted but others of which were disputed. The fact that the applicant’s estimates were not contested by the respondent’s counsel at trial, would not mean, without more, that the respondent’s estimates on the same line items ought then to be rejected in favour of the applicant’s estimates. Indeed, the applicant’s counsel went on to cross-examine the respondent on his competing estimates of the same line items. In the circumstances, I did not think there was any unfairness at trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I would also explain that in arriving at the Court’s assessment of the children’s reasonable expenses, I had, where appropriate, given more weight to the applicant’s estimates, for the simple reason that she was in a better position to understand the children’s expenses – it was undisputed that the respondent had never lived with her and the children. The applicant had also provided some receipts for various expenses. That being said, the law does not require every specific item of expense to be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise (see <em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> at [13]). It followed that even if every item of expense was somehow proved, “the mere fact that one party shows that such expenditure was made does not automatically render that expenditure reasonable in the context of determining maintenance”: see <em>WBU v WBT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a> at [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     On the whole, I found that some estimates of the applicant were higher than what would have been reasonable in the circumstances, and I had pared them down in exercising my discretion. On the applicant’s own case, she had had limited means – to the extent of having to borrow to make ends meet. Her evidence was that she took home about $2,400 a month, but the total of her estimated personal expenses and the children’s expenses was hitting $14,000 a month – close to six times more. In this regard, the Court heard that the applicant’s own evidence was that her personal financial circumstances had worsened, such that she was taking loans from her credit line “to finance her monthly expenses”, and obtaining money from friends and even the respondent’s relatives, who she was apparently acquainted with and had given her “some money”. Given that this apparently parlous situation had existed, on her own evidence, for some years, she would have been spending beyond her means, the implication being that there should be, or should have been, room for more sustainable budgeting. As explained below, I did find that the applicant’s means was probably higher than what her income from her full-time job would have suggested. Even then, I still found that her estimated expenses were too high in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In considering the standard of living that the children should reasonably enjoy, I gave some consideration to the principle that that parties were to bear their own expenses when spending on luxuries (see <em>VZJ v VZK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31161-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 16</a>). This was especially the case where the respondent had never lived with the applicant and the children, and on the evidence of both parties, maintenance had never been given by him for the children’s upkeep, which would therefore have had been solely based on the applicant’s efforts. Having heard the evidence, I did accept that the respondent was a <em>potential</em> provider of some means, but he was neither a <em>past</em> nor <em>present</em> provider. Intuitively, there was some resonance to the suggestion that a father ought to maintain the children similarly to how he had been maintaining the children from his marriage. However, direct comparisons with the expenses of his own family could only go so far, as every family situation was different, and the ages and stages of life of the children were also different.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Neglect to make reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having established the reasonable expenses of the children as $5,165.46, the question was whether there had been neglect or refusal to pay reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The applicant bore the burden to prove neglect. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, on the respondent’s own case, he had never paid maintenance for the children. It was also the applicant’s position that the respondent had never maintained the children. In the premises, I agreed with the applicant’s submission that whatever the amount of reasonable maintenance, the respondent would have neglected to make that amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the respondent knew he was the biological parent before the application was made in March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     However, the question in this case was precisely <em>when</em> the neglect arose. This implicated the question of when the respondent knew that he was the father to the children – was it before the application was made in March 2024?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The duty of parents to maintain their children is clearly set out in section 68 of the Women’s Charter. The duty of a parent to maintain a child is rooted in biological fact – a parent should, without more, care for his or her own flesh and blood, where the child is unable to fend for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, knowledge is nevertheless relevant in deciding the question of whether there had been neglect of the duty to maintain the child under section 69. The elements of “neglect” or “refusal” suggests that some species of knowledge or intention is necessary in the omission to provide reasonable maintenance, and it would seem unreasonable to hold a parent as liable for neglect if he had not even been aware that he was the parent of a child. The touchstone for the conduct of the parties is reasonableness: <em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [58]. Where it is unclear if a parent had knowledge of his status as a biological parent, it might not be reasonable to hold that he had neglected to make reasonable maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In this regard, the applicant had adduced various pieces of evidence. I had examined them. Whether taken alone or together, they did not lead to the finding that on the balance of probabilities, the respondent possessed the requisite knowledge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     First, there were some photographs of the respondent with the daughter, and one photo with the son. On the photographs with the daughter, these included the respondent posing with her at a hotpot restaurant on her birthday, ostensibly in Oct 2022, and images of the respondent carrying her in a mall, and accompanying her to the zoo. In my view, those photographs were at the highest, piecemeal indications that the respondent had held himself out as a parent. It should be noted that the parties were in a relationship until June 2023, and it would not have been unusual for him to tend to the children as part and parcel of his relationship with the applicant, especially when they were going out. There appeared to be no photographs after the parties’ relationship ended in June 2023. While the respondent might have suspected that he was a parent to the daughter, that would not rise to the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological parent. In short, multiple inferences might be drawn from the photographs, of which the inference that the respondent had acknowledged the daughter as his biological daughter was only one of them. It was the same analysis for the lone photograph of the respondent with the infant son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I next turned to the exchange of text messages in June 2023 – when the parties’ relationship was on the rocks. This was arguably stronger evidence in support of the applicant’s case. As the applicant’s counsel pointed out, the applicant had asked the respondent to “please ensure the transfer of the child’s expenses of $3,000 to my account on time every 1<sup>st</sup> of the month. You have not done so for this month – please do so quickly!” The respondent’s response was simply to ask the applicant not to be so “extreme”. There was no denial. This would appear to be suggestive that the respondent had at least assumed responsibility as the parent to at least one of the children. As the applicant’s counsel highlighted, the respondent’s explanations of the exchange of messages were dubious – I attached no weight to them and found that the explanations in fact damaged his general credibility as a witness. However, there remained the question of which child was being referred to in the message, and whether that meant that the status of the other child was in question. Moreover, at trial, the parties were content with the position that the respondent had never provided maintenance for the children in the first place – this limited the inferences that might have been drawn from that message.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Critically, there was also evidence that pointed the other way. The most significant of this evidence was the statutory declaration that had been made by the applicant. In this case, the applicant had made a statement in 2016 that the daughter’s “biological father who is of Malaysia Nationality is no longer in contact with me. His name and whereabouts are unknown”. Given that a statutory declaration is a statement made to declare something to be true, absent any proof that the applicant had lied in the statutory declaration, it must be assumed that the applicant was stating the truth in the statutory declaration, which she tendered to HDB in 2020 as part of her request to buy a resale flat while retaining two private residential properties in Malaysia. This declaration was known to the respondent at the material time. It should also be noted that it was undisputed between the parties that the applicant did have a Malaysian boyfriend.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     For completeness, I had also considered evidence such as the respondent having passed an “ang pow” to the daughter in June 2023, and the respondent forwarding information on direct school admissions in May 2023 to the applicant. But whether taken singly or together, having weighed the totality of the evidence, I found that the burden of proof had not been crossed insofar as proving that the applicant had the requisite level of knowledge that he was the biological father of both children. By extension, the applicant had not proven that there had been neglect to provide reasonable maintenance in the period preceding the application. It was likely that the applicant had suspected that he was the parent to one or even both children, but that was in any event not tantamount to actually having knowledge or positively acknowledging that he was their father, with all the attendant responsibilities of providing of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In any event, I also found that there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication, which was necessary to establish neglect. One way that the Court can consider “reasonableness” is whether one party had reasonably communicated the child’s needs or expenses to the other part. In this regard, the courts have held that the alleged non-paying party “must be aware or ought to have been aware of the child’s needs or expenses” (<em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [48]). Consonant with the finding that there was insufficient evidence of knowledge on the respondent’s part that he was the parent to the children, there was insufficient evidence of reasonable communication from the applicant to the respondent in relation to maintenance required for the children’s purported expenses, whether basic or otherwise. In her testimony, the applicant had said: “Over the past 9 years, he did not give us any amount allowance (<em>sic</em>).” Against this rather lengthy period, there was a paucity of evidence that requests for maintenance had been made. As mentioned above, while there was an exchange of text messages on the applicant purportedly asking the respondent to pay $3,000 a month for the child, there was a limit to the conclusions that might be drawn from that isolated exchange. In the event that I were wrong, I had taken the view that any backdating of maintenance should only be as far back as the time of filing the application – this will be discussed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Having found that the respondent had neglected to pay reasonable maintenance from the time of application, the question remained as to the quantum that the respondent ought to be ordered to pay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The law is clear that both parties have an equal responsibility to provide for the children although their precise obligations may differ based on their means and capacities: <em>UHA v UHB and anor appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> at [36].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In this regard, I had reviewed the evidence and submissions of the parties’ respective income, means and assets. The respondent’s take-home salary was $5,438. In terms of the respondent, the respondent’s counsel submitted that as a company director, the respondent’s salary was “heavily dependent” on the company’s performance – and the company was loss-making. Further, the respondent had had to resort to borrowing from the banks and friends to fund his business expenditures and living expenses, with over $250,000 in debt to friends and family, and total debts and liabilities of over $2.3m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Nevertheless, I agreed with the applicant’s counsel’s submission that the respondent was a man of means, notwithstanding the purportedly poor financial state of his businesses in Singapore and Malaysia, and his apparent debts. He had higher financial means than what his income suggested. For example, while the respondent had claimed that he had taken various loans, some of them appeared to be friendly loans, in the sense that he was not subject to strict repayment timelines and other terms. An example would be a purported loan from the respondent’s wife, and another loan from his mother-in-law. It followed that the respondent’s financial situation was not as precipitous as he had suggested. While I was persuaded that he did have certain formal liabilities with financial institutions, the preponderance of the evidence suggested that the respondent had enjoyed a significant degree of free play and flexibility in managing his incomings and outgoings, through his ability to access both his personal and corporate accounts. It followed that even if he was in a net negative position, he was more likely than not, able to raise and rustle up sums of monies when the need occasioned. He had a demonstrated ability to finance his not-inconsiderable expenditure, whether through borrowings or otherwise. I therefore accepted the submission of the applicant’s counsel that “notwithstanding the alleged shortfall in his income to meet his expenses, and the alleged loans taken out… he has been able to pay down the alleged loans as and when he needed to”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The respondent’s counsel submitted that the respondent had been “struggling to make ends meet without sacrificing the lifestyle enjoyed by his family”. I accepted that the respondent had two older children from his marriage in their mid-teens, who were likely to incur more expenses as they progressed to tertiary education in the coming years. However, I based my findings on current finances. In any event, he had a duty to maintain <em>all</em> his biological children. Even if he had to make further changes to his lifestyle to support the maintenance payments, he would need to do so. Moreover, in relation to his family, the respondent had stated on affidavit that he had seven people living in his residence, and the expenses were borne by both him and his wife. This at least suggested that his wife was able to bear some of his financial load insofar as this pertained to the financial aspects of his married life. It did not appear that his in-laws were totally bereft of financial means as well, such that they required his full support.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In relation to the applicant, the Court heard that the applicant’s financial situation had worsened over the past several years, suffering two distinct drops in salary to the present amount of $3,000 a month (take-home $2,399). Further, the applicant’s counsel submitted that unlike the respondent, the applicant did not have other sources of income from which she could draw from as and when necessary. While the applicant had set up a sole proprietorship, the applicant’s counsel submitted that any additional income was “ad hoc”, and not sufficient, stable, nor predictable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I found that the applicant was of a weaker financial standing than the respondent. However, I was of the view that the applicant’s financial means was likely to be more than her income suggested. The respondent’s counsel pointed out that her personal bank account showed inflows and outflows of money to the tune of thousands of dollars every month. What I noted was that the applicant, at the relatively younger age of 39, had significant earning capacity. Besides running a business on top of her salaried employment, she appeared to have – or had – properties in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. And while her tenant broke lease in September 2023, she might be able to rent out a room for more income. Based on the statements from her Business Growth Account, while the applicant said that the transfers made to her personal account were withdrawn in cash for payment to suppliers, it appeared that that was not always the case, as there appeared to have been withdrawals made at a toy shop and eateries. In any event, the applicant had also confirmed that she could be flexible with her personal expenses as long as the children were provided for – suggesting that she had some free play and flexibility as well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Bearing in mind all the above considerations, I decided to use a rough and ready proxy for apportionment, as based on the stated monthly incomes – at 70:30 as between the respondent and the applicant. The figures had been adjusted slightly from about 69:31. I thought this would be fair. With the reasonable maintenance being $5,165.46, and applying the ratio, the respondent ought to be paying $3,616 a month (rounded down to $3,600). Having reviewed the expenses of both the respondent and the applicant, I was of the view that this apportionment would fall within their respective means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Backdated maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As mentioned above, in terms of backdating maintenance, I backdated only as far back as the time of the application in March 2024. The parties relied on <em>Lee Siew Choo v Ling Chin Thor</em> [2014] SGHC 185, where the High Court set out a list of factors to be considered in determining of backdated maintenance. There are overlaps in terms of the intent behind these factors, and I considered these factors in the light of the facts and circumstances. The applicant did not file for maintenance until March 2024, even though the daughter and the son were born in 2016 and 2022 respectively. Why she did not do so was therefore of critical importance. In this regard, among other explanations, the applicant’s counsel submitted that prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, when the applicant was earning $10,000 to $12,000 at the respondent’s company, she was in a position to pay for the children’s expenses singlehandedly, and therefore did not need the assistance of the respondent. However, she subsequently suffered drops in salaries and changes of circumstances, such that she had to make the present application. The applicant’s counsel highlighted that the timeframe for backdated maintenance – for up to three years prior to March 2024 – aligned with the timeframe of the applicant’s first drop in salary, from $10,000 to $12,000, to $5,000 to $6,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I did not discount the struggles of a single mother having to bring up two children. However, having reviewed the evidence, it did not appear that she was in that tight of a financial bind between March 2021 and March 2024, compared to the period thereafter. For the most part, save for nine months between June 2023 and March 2024, her salary was still at $5,000 to $6,000 a month. The son was not born until May 2022, so her financial burden would not have had significantly increased until then. It appeared that the applicant’s financial situation became much more of an issue only from the time her relationship with the respondent ended, culminating in her departure from his company in June 2023. Indeed, it was telling that her request to the respondent for $3,000 for the child took place then – the Court had not seen evidence of earlier requests of such money. The applicant was unemployed from June to October 2023, but she nevertheless had the benefit of a lease until September 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, I did find that her financial needs continued to worsen thereafter – this was supported by evidence that she had taken out loans more recently. For example, she claimed to have borrowed $1,500 from her friend to repay her car loan in June 2024. The applicant’s counsel also highlighted her bank loans, which were reflected in the DBS Cashline statements from 2024. On the whole, it appeared that the need for child maintenance became more acute from the time that she left the respondent’s company in June 2023. This would have eventually prompted her to make the application in March 2024. Her sole proprietorship was also set up in June 2023 – while this might be seen as a new revenue source, it might also be inferred that she saw the need to seek avenues to shore up her financial situation at or around that period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I was minded for the payments for maintenance to start from August 2024, when the paternity results were known. However, I found that the balance was better struck by ordering that the backdated maintenance was to be paid from the time of application in March 2024. As mentioned above, this was independent of my finding that there had been no neglect on the part of the respondent to maintain the children prior to March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The order for maintenance was therefore that the respondent was to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance. Payment was to start from September 2025. The respondent was to pay backdated maintenance from 28 March 2024, the month when the application was filed – for a total of 18 months. This amount was to be paid in instalments of $1,200. The payment was to be made at the end of every month to the applicant’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I noted that this amount ought not to be crushing for the respondent, as on his own submission, he was able to make payments of close to $5,000 a month – with his suggested $2,936.89 for monthly maintenance and request to pay maintenance arrears through $2,000 in monthly instalments. At the same time, with the maintenance, the applicant should have sufficient funds with which to bring up her children, while she continued to strengthen her financial footing. Of course, parties were at liberty to seek variations in the event of material change or other good cause.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Cost of paternity testing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Ahead of hearing parties on costs, I dealt with the residual issue of who ought to bear the cost of paternity testing. The applicant’s counsel cited the recent case of <em>XIB v XIA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33441-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 40</a> in support of his contention that the respondent ought to bear the full costs. That case stood on stronger facts that militated in favour of an order for the father to bear the costs of the DNA test. The parties in that case had been married, with the child concerned conceived about eight years into the union. Given the facts of that case, it was patently unreasonable for the father to cast unsubstantiated aspersions on the paternity of the child. In the present case, the parties had never been married to each other. They had other partners. There were two children, who were both born out of wedlock. Moreover, as mentioned above, the applicant had stated through a statutory declaration that the respondent was not the biological father of the daughter. Despite that, while I had found that the respondent did not have the requisite level of knowledge for the purpose of finding neglect to maintain the children, I was of the view that he had at least been happy to go along with the <em>status quo</em>, even going out and posing with the children for photographs, until the parties ended their relationship in June 2023. While he would have at least suspected or wondered about the paternity, he did not issue a flat-out denial when the applicant sought $3,000 for the child via text message – at the terminal stage of the parties’ relationship. In the circumstances, I did not think that it would be unreasonable for the respondent to foot the full cost of paternity testing. The request to definitively resolve the paternity question only arose after the receipt of the application for child maintenance, in which the applicant had already taken the position that the respondent was the biological father. At that juncture in the life of the case, it could even be said that the respondent needed to know the result more. As the applicant had initially paid for a half-share of the costs of the paternity test, on the basis that the Court would eventually determine where the costs should fall, that sum was to be reimbursed to her by the respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having heard counsel on costs, I made no order as to costs, save for ordering the respondent to pay $500 to the applicant for the adjournment of an earlier trial date in April 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     My orders were therefore summarised as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Respondent is to pay $3,600, being $1,800 for each of the two children, in monthly maintenance. Payment will start from September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The payment will be made on or by the end of every month to the applicant’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The respondent is to pay backdated maintenance from March 2024 in the sum of $64,800 (being 18 months x $3,600).

These slips show the following:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     From 2012 to 2015 – There were multiple remittances in each of these years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2016 – There was one remittance in March.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     2017 – There were two remittances, one in October and the other in December.

To support this contention, he exhibited a search result from Deepseek which showed that the property’s market value in December 2022 averaged between RMB 7.5 million to RMB 7.9 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife denied having been the owner of the Xiamen property and claimed not to have any information regarding it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> According to her, the remittances were for the Husband’s travel and entertainment expenses during his 23 trips to China between December 2011 and March 2019.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">A.    <u>Husband contributed $260,000 towards the Xiamen property</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Having considered the evidence, I accepted the Husband’s claim that he had contributed a total of $260,000 towards the purchase of the Xiamen property: see [12] and [13] above. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I agree with the Husband that the Wife’s claim is extraordinary and unbelievable. There is simply “no cogent reason for him to remit the money to the [Wife] … just to pay for his entertainment and travel expenses in China when he could easily use his credit cards and/or carry cash with him”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, extraordinary claims require proof before they are worthy of belief. In this case, the Wife had failed to produce any evidence to support her bare and dubious claim that the remittances – totaling more than a quarter of a million dollars – were the Husband’s travel and entertainment expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the periodic nature and quantum of such remittances (with some as high as between $20,000 to $35,000)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> are more consistent with them being progress payments for the purchase of the Xiamen property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">B.    <u>Xiamen property is a matrimonial asset</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Having accepted the Husband’s claim regarding the Xiamen property, I now come to the issue of whether it was a “matrimonial asset” and thus liable for division under s 112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). On this issue, s 112(10) defines “matrimonial asset” to mean –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>a</em>)    any asset acquired <em>before</em> the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <em>ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties</em> or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>b</em>)    any other asset of any nature acquired <em>during</em> the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On a plain reading of s 112(10), an important issue when determining whether a property is a “matrimonial asset” is <em>the time when it was “acquired”</em>. Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” as referring not to the point of purchase of a property – but the time when it has been fully paid for: <em>XCR v XCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33368-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 64</a> at [11] to [13].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In this regard, I noted that the Xiamen property had not been fully paid up – and thus had <em>not</em> been “acquired” – <em>before</em> marriage: s 112(10)(a). The remittance slips show that the Husband was still making payments for the property in December 2017 – i.e., one month after the marriage in November 2017.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Next, I considered whether the Xiamen property was “acquired <em>during</em> the marriage” and thus constituted “matrimonial property” under s 112(10)(b). In my view, the answer is yes. <em>First</em>, there is no evidence to show that further remittances/payments had been made towards the acquisition of the Xiamen property after December 2017. <em>Second</em>, the Wife was able to sell the property in 2020 – during the marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">C.    <u>Value of the Xiamen property</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having found that the Xiamen property is a matrimonial asset, I shall now determine its value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     According to the Records, the property was sold in <em>2020</em> for RMB 2 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband contended that (a) the recorded price of RMB 2 million is “fictious” and “below market value” and (b) the property should be valued at RMB 7 million instead. This valuation is based on transaction prices of similar units in 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I am unable to accept the Husband’s contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, he had failed to provide any evidence to show why I should go behind the Records to find that the property had in fact been sold at a higher price of RMB 7 million. For instance, he did not produce any evidence to show that similar units were sold at that price in 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, I found it to be unreasonable to value the Xiamen property based on prices in 2022 – i.e., <em>two years after it was sold</em> – given that property prices are known to be dynamic and sensitive to economic, political, and other considerations. In this context, I noted that the property was sold in 2020 – the year when the world was gripped by fears surrounding the COVID pandemic.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">D.    <u>Division of the sale proceeds of the Xiamen property</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Having determined that the Xiamen property was sold for RMB 2 million, the next issue is how the sale proceeds ought to be divided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Applying the structured approach (see [8] and [9] above), I noted the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Direct financial contributions</em>. The Husband had contributed RMB 1,265,680 ($260,000) towards the acquisition of the Xiamen property. These contributions represent “over 70% of the purchase price” of RMB 1.8 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Indirect contributions.</em> There is no evidence that the parties had made any indirect contributions towards the Xiamen property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I found that it would be “just and equitable” for the Husband to be awarded $260,000 from the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Xiamen property was a “joint investment”. Most of the parties’ contributions towards acquiring the property were made before marriage. There is no evidence that the property had served as a matrimonial home, or that the parties had made indirect contributions towards it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the circumstances, it would be reasonable to divide the sale proceeds just like any other joint investments. In this regard, it is usual to divide such investments based on the parties’ respective contributions towards them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In this case, the Husband had contributed RMB 1,265,680 ($260,000) towards the Xiamen property. Applying the usual approach, the Husband should receive 70% of the sale proceeds of RMB 2 million – i.e., RMB 1.4 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Husband had requested the return of only his contributions of $260,000 (RMB 1,265,680) from the sale proceeds.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> This amount is <em>lower</em> than RMB 1,400,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Acceding to the Husband’s request would not cause the Wife to suffer any financial detriment. In fact, she would receive a windfall of RMB 134,320 (i.e., RMB 1.4 million minus RMB 1,265,680) from her joint investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband’s assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Declared assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I shall now turn to the Husband’s assets.

This is especially so when there is a court order that has required her to provide specified banking information. In this case, she would have no difficulty complying with the court order. I infer that the only reason why she had intentionally refused to provide the banking information is because they would have contradicted her contention that she is unemployed: <em>Chan Pui Yin v Lim Tiong Kei</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 4 SLR 0875.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 875</a> at [39]; <em>BPC v BPB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a> at [60]. Accordingly, I found that the Wife is gainfully employed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Next, I considered whether spousal maintenance should be ordered in this case. Generally, such maintenance is intended to serve two objectives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, to mitigate the financial impact of a divorce on a former wife: see s 114(2) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, to even out any financial inequalities between the parties which may exist after the division of matrimonial assets. Such inequalities may have arisen because of economic prejudice suffered by the former wife during the marriage: <em>Tan Sue-Ann Melissa v Lim Siang Bok Dennis</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2004] 3 SLR(R) 0376.xml')\">[2004] 3 SLR(R) 376</a> at [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">No order for spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Bearing in mind the applicable principles, I declined to order spousal maintenance for the Wife. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_a\"></a>(a)     At all material times, the Wife had been living in China – apart from the Husband. There is no evidence that the marriage had caused her to suffer any economic prejudice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the contrary, the Wife had been free to pursue her career and aspirations. She appears to have been able to take care of herself financially all this while. There is no evidence that she had required or received spousal maintenance during the eight years of her marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_51-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Given the above, there is no reason to believe that the divorce will cause her to suffer any financial detriment for which she will need financial assistance in the form of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     For the above reasons, I made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Each party is to retain her/her assets in their sole names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Wife is to pay <b>$235,818.58</b> to the Husband within six months of this judgement. (I granted the Wife more time to pay the sum to the Husband given the significant amount involved.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_52-p2_c\"></a>(c)     No order for spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     Finally, I make no order as to costs.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [17].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [11] to [16] and [25] to [27].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 21 March 2025 (exhibited at the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at page 12); Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit dated 02.07.25 at [9].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at page 110 to 133.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at [11] and pages 27 to 30.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at [19(m)] and page 110 to 133; Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See the Wife’s Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 21 March 2025 (exhibited at the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at page 12).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit dated 02.07.25 at [10] and [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [15].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>See the remittance slip for 11.12.17 at the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 page 129.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>See the remittance slip for 11.12.17 at the Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 page 133.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at page 110 to 133.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 21 March 2025 (exhibited at the Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at page 12).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [14] and [20]; Defendant’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at [19(m)] and [23]; Defendant’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit for Ancillary Matters dated 27.06.25 at [11].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [9].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at [6(e)].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [10(b)].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [18].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Plaintiff (Wife)’s Written Submissions dated 16.09.25 at [9] to [17] and [26]; Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at [23] to [26]; Wife’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Ancillary Affidavit dated 02.07.25 at [4] to [6].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [19] to [23].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Plaintiff (Wife)’s Written Submissions dated 16.09.25 at [26(c)]; Wife’s Affidavit of Assets and Means dated 25.02.25 at [32].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Defendant’s Written Submissions on Ancillary Matters dated 16.09.25 at [29] to [32].</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>See her Notice in Response to Request for Discovery dated 21 March 2025.

He faced a total of 20 charges, out of which the Prosecution proceeded with 12, with the remaining 8 charges to be taken into consideration with his consent. Ben pleaded guilty to the 12 proceeded charges. On 21 July 2025, after making the finding of guilt, I ordered that he be sent to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (“JRC”) i.e. the Singapore Boys’ Home (“SBH”) for a period of 24 months. There is no appeal against my order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The salient facts of the 12 charges</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I will set out in brief the salient facts of the 12 charges to which Ben pleaded guilty.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900155-2025 – Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 5 March 2025, Ben and his friend, T met the victim and agreed to inhale ‘K-pod’ (a vaping device) together. When the victim did not agree to let T borrow his ‘K-pod’ device, a fight broke out. Both Ben and T punched and kicked the victim multiple times on the face, body and leg, causing the latter to fall to the ground. Even while the victim was on the floor, they continued assaulting him until he began bleeding from the mouth and nose.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Ben and T then asked the victim if he had any valuables on him. The victim denied having any. Ben and T proceeded to search the victim’s pockets and threatened to slash him with a karambit knife if he did not cooperate (although no knife was actually produced). Ben then took the victim’s ‘K-pod’ device and fled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The victim sustained multiple injuries including a lip contusion and nasal bone fracture.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Ben pleaded guilty to the offence punishable under section 394 of the Penal Code 1871 (the “Penal Code”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-9000264-2025 – Harassing a Public Servant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 1 May 2025, Ben’s mother, Madam Lee (<em>not her real name</em>) called ‘999’ stating that “My son is going crazy”. Two police officers were dispatched to respond to the incident report. Upon their arrival, Mdm Lee showed the police officers a vaping device and explained that her son had not been acting normally since using it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       One of the police officers (the “SPF officer”) noticed that Ben was agitated and asked him to sit down, upon which Ben shouted at him. The SPF officer noticed cuts on Ben’s legs and insisted that paramedics check on his injuries. Ben refused and continued to be aggressive, shouting vulgarities at the SPF officer during their exchange.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 6(1) of the Protection from Harassment Act 2014, punishable under section 6(3) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900361-2025 – Causing or contributing to risk of dangerous fire</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 29 September 2024, Ben had met four other friends to celebrate a birthday at the void deck of a block of HDB flats. One of the friends had brought a lighter to light the candles on the birthday cake. While the group was sitting around the table at the void deck, Ben used the lighter to set a pair of wooden chopsticks on fire and thereafter placed the burning chopsticks on the table, which caused the plastic tabletop to sustain damage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The police were alerted to this incident through a ‘999’ call about “a few teenagers playing with fire at the ground floor”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 285(1)(c) of the Penal Code, punishable under section 285(2)(b) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900362-2025 – Theft in dwelling house etc. with Common Intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On 12 August 2023, Ben and another friend, H, were in a shop at Harbourfront Centre and took food and drinks with a total value of $40.20 without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Their actions were captured on CCTV. The store staff asked them to return the items in their hands. They complied and left the store. Upon reviewing the CCTV footage, the store staff realised that there was a further item which had been placed in H’s bag and not returned. The store staff subsequently called the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence under section 380 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900368-2025 – Amalgamated Shop Theft</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On 25 June 2023, Ben took four packets of ‘Kinder Bueno’ chocolates valued at $9.40 from a supermarket without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     On 13 July 2023, Ben took a bottle of perfume valued at $140 from a shop at Nex without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     On 9 April 2024, Ben took one pair of white socks valued at $5.90 from a shop at Nex without paying for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On 20 May 2024, Ben took a Logitech G/MSE gaming mouse valued at $189 from a shop at Nex without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     As such, Ben committed shop theft on four separate occasions under section 380 of the Penal Code, which taken together amounted to a course of conduct. He pleaded guilty to an amalgamated charge under section 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 which is punishable under section 124(8)(a)(ii) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC 9000380-2025 – Voluntarily Causing Hurt with Common Intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The victim was a 13-year-old male. On 24 July 2023, the victim’s aunt called ‘999’ to report that her nephew had been beaten up outside his school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The investigations revealed that after hearing that the victim had badmouthed Ben and two other youths, they confronted the victim and brought him to a staircase landing at a multi-storey carpark. They started assaulting the victim by punching, kicking and pushing him multiple times on the face and torso. This caused the victim’s head to be slammed against the floor and wall. He lost consciousness for approximately 10 minutes and when he regained consciousness, he vomited twice and suffered pain in his head, chest, back and abdomen. The victim had multiple superficial injuries to his left ear, left knee, chest and abdomen.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt punishable under section 323 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YAC-900390-2025 – Theft with common intention</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     On 5 February 2024, Ben and another youth, R, came across a listing on Carousell (an online platform) advertising a personal mobility device (“PMD”) battery for sale at $700. They came up with a plan to meet with the seller, take and flee with the PMD battery, without paying for it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Later in the evening on the same day, they met up with the seller. During the meeting, R requested to test the PMD battery before making payment. The seller agreed and handed the battery over to R, who installed it onto his electric scooter and instructed Ben to “test” the scooter. Ben then fled on the electric scooter with the PMD battery while R fled on foot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The seller gave chase and managed to intercept Ben. He instructed Ben to call R back and to make payment. However, Ben fled a second time on the electric scooter. In attempting to stop him, the seller held onto Ben’s arm and was dragged forward; this caused him to fall and sustain superficial cuts to the left side of his face.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Ben pleaded guilty to the offence of theft punishable under section 379 read with section 34 of the Penal Code.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">YCN 900002-2025 to YCN 900006-2025 – Possession of vaporiser (i.e. vaping device)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Ben was found to be in possession of vaporiser(s) (i.e. vaping device(s)) at various locations on the following occasions: 4 February 2024, 19 March 2024, 30 May 2024, 9 June 2024, and 19 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     He therefore contravened section 16(3)(a) of the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act 1993; he pleaded guilty to 5 offences punishable under section 16(7) of the same Act.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision on the Appropriate Order</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Discussion on the law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The two-stage framework for dealing with youthful offenders was set out and elaborated in the case of <em>PP v Koh Wen Jie Boaz</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18361-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 334</a> (“<em>Boaz</em>”) (at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">At the first stage of the sentencing process, the task for the court is to identify and prioritise the primary sentencing considerations appropriate to the youth in question having regard to all the circumstances including those of the offence. This will then set the parameters for the second stage of the inquiry, which is to select the appropriate sentence that would best meet those sentencing considerations and the priority that the sentencing judge has placed upon the relevant ones.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In relation to the first stage, Sundaresh Menon CJ had observed in <em>Boaz</em> that there were four illustrative circumstances where the focus on rehabilitation may be diminished or even eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution. These are where: (a) the offence is serious; (b) the harm caused is severe; (c) the offender is hardened or recalcitrant; or (d) the conditions do not exist to make rehabilitative sentencing options such as probation or reformative training viable (see also <em>PP v CPS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32549-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGCA 59</a>, at [4]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I note from the cases that the “primary sentencing consideration” of rehabilitation is generally <b><em>not</em></b> diminished or eclipsed when we consider the first stage of the framework in relation to the youth offenders dealt with by the Youth Courts. For example, in <em>PP v GFM</em> (a minor) <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29557-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGYC 4</a> (“<em>PP v GFM”)</em>, when considering the first stage of the framework in <em>Boaz</em>, I had considered the youth’s relatively young age and her rehabilitative potential in concluding that rehabilitation should be the dominant consideration:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>1<sup>st</sup> stage - Rehabilitation being the dominant consideration</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Ella was only 13 years old when she committed most of the offences to which she pleaded guilty or for which she gave her consent to be taken into consideration in the determination of the outcome. At the time of the hearing before me, she had turned 14 years of age. Given her relatively young age, I was of the view that she does have rehabilitative potential. I therefore affirmed that I was guided by rehabilitation as the dominant consideration in determining the most appropriate order in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Following the case of <em>PP v GFM</em>, I have come more firmly to the view that the <b><em>focus</em></b> of the Youth Courts <b><em>must be</em></b> on rehabilitation of the children or young persons dealt with and found guilty by the Youth Courts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     First, the Youth Courts are mainly governed by the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (“CYPA”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> Section 34(1)(b) of the CYPA mandates the Youth Court, when dealing with a child or young person brought before it, either as being in need of care and protection, or as an offender or otherwise, to “facilitate the protection and <b><em>rehabilitation of the child or young person</em></b>, and his or her reintegration with his or her family and with society”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Secondly, section 4(b) of the CYPA provides that “in all matters relating to the administration or application of the [CYPA], the welfare and best interests of the child or young person must be the first and paramount consideration”. This is the statutory guiding principle whenever a child or young person is the subject of consideration under the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, the principle of “best interests of a child or young person” in the context of the youth justice system should fundamentally centre only on rehabilitation and the child’s or young person’s present and future well-being. Such a “best interests” principle is in stark contrast to the societal aims of retribution and deterrence. When punishment is imposed primarily to send a message to others or to satisfy the public demands for retribution, the child’s or young person’s individual needs, circumstances and potential for positive change become secondary considerations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     When we consider what truly serves a child’s or young person’s best interests within the criminal justice system, the answer invariably points towards interventions that addresses the underlying causes of offending behaviour, develops his or her capacity for positive social engagement and maximises his or her successful reintegration into society. The rehabilitative approach recognises that children and young persons are still developing cognitively, emotionally and socially, making them particularly responsive to therapeutic and educational interventions rather than pure punitive measures.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Thirdly, the options available to the Youth Court in exercise of its power on proof of an offence under section 49(1) of the CYPA are generally rehabilitative in nature; this includes even those that are generally regarded as more ‘severe’ in nature such as the granting of orders to send the youth offender to a JRC (s 49(1)(i)) or to undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre (s 49(1)(k)).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     While a detention order (made under s 49(1)(g)) or a fine (imposed under s49(1)(j)) are not inherently rehabilitative, such orders have rehabilitative potential. Sitting as a Youth Court judge, I seldom grant a detention order on its own. The detention order, if granted, is normally paired with a probation order; this is because it is believed or assessed that such a combination of orders, in appropriate cases, will be <em>more effective in strengthening the resolve</em> of the youth offenders to turn over a new leaf and strive for positive change. As for fines, these are not normally imposed at all, but the rare cases in which fines were imposed would show that such an order had generally been made where the offence(s) were of a regulatory nature and/or the youth offender has a low risk of re-offending. The fines would signal to the youth offenders of such profiles that there are consequences to their actions in contravening the law and it would not always be the case that they are simply let off with a caution or a warning on account of their youth (as some of the youth offenders are wont to think), thereby building and strengthening their consequential thinking abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Before moving on to the appropriate order, I should make the observation that the focus on rehabilitation by the Youth Courts does not result in young persons who commit serious crimes receiving inappropriately lenient treatment. When young persons commit serious offences, they can still be dealt with by other courts of appropriate jurisdiction – rather than the Youth Courts – to ensure that the severity of their sentences or orders remain commensurate with the gravity of the offences committed. For example, under section 39(2) of the CYPA, where a child or young person is charged with any offence triable only by the General Division of the High Court, he or she <u>must</u> be tried by the General Division of the High Court unless (i) the Public Prosecutor applies to the Youth Court to try such offence; and (ii) the legal representative of the child or young person concerned consents to the offence being tried by the Youth Court. In due course, when the amendments to the CYPA to raise the upper age limit of young offenders dealt with by the Youth Courts to under 18 years old come into effect, those who are 16 to under 18 years old and commit serious offences or are repeat offenders may be dealt with by the District Courts or the General Division of the High Court; such cases may be transferred to a court of appropriate jurisdiction by the Youth Court on its own motion or upon receiving the necessary fiat in writing by the Public Prosecutor. As explained by the then Minister for Social and Family Development, Mr Desmond Lee at the second reading of the Children and Young Persons (Amendment) Bill, this was “intended as a deterrent that we are not soft on crimes, especially those of a serious nature and that there are times where firmer punishment of the offender is warranted, in spite of his youth”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The appropriate order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I would have been minded to direct for a probation suitability report to see whether it is suitable for Ben to be placed on probation as <em>his rehabilitative option</em>. The prosecution made no objections to the calling of a probation suitability report in Ben’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Ben’s mother, however, voiced out her helplessness in managing Ben’s behaviours at home. After a fuller discussion with her in the court session, I came to the determination that probation would not be a suitable option for Ben. Ben’s parents were divorced and his mother has sole custody, care and control of him. Ben’s father is currently serving a prison sentence; even if he had been involved in Ben’s life after the divorce, he would be in no capacity to help the mother in her supervision of Ben. There were also no other appropriate family members who could come alongside the mother to support Ben in the community. The lack of strong familial support and supervision does not bode well for a smooth and successful probation journey for Ben. This being the case, I was of the view that it may be more appropriate and in his best interests for him to be sent to a JRC i.e. the SBH, where he can undergo targeted programmes under the supervision and guidance of the professionals and youth case workers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Upon my invitation to submit on the appropriate length of the JRC order, the prosecution stated that it should be no less than 24 months given the nature and the multiplicity of the offences. Ben’s mother made no comments or remarks in reply, preferring to leave the order in the Court’s hands. I agreed with the prosecution’s position and thus made the JRC order of 24 months. I took the view that 24 months would be an appropriate duration, giving sufficient runway for the intervention programmes at the SBH to work and effect Ben’s rehabilitation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I encouraged Ben’s mother to support him in his rehabilitation journey by visiting him and working closely with the officers at SBH. I also encouraged Ben to turn his focus back onto his studies and approach his residence at the SBH and the intervention programmes with a firm resolve for positive change and a cooperative spirit.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The youthful offender in <em>Boaz</em> was not dealt with by the Youth Court at first instance; therefore section 46(1) of the CYPA does not apply.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Section 35(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 provides that “A Youth Court has the jurisdiction and powers conferred on it by the Children and Young Persons Act 1993”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup><em>Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official report</em> (3 September 2019), Vol No 94, Sitting No 110</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-09-25","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1394 of 2024","title":"XSD v XSE","citation":"[2025] SGFC 102","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33902-SSP.xml","counsel":["The Husband in person and unrepresented","Tan Mao Lin (Jacque Law LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-10-03T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XSD v XSE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XSD <em>v</em> XSE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33902-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 102</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1394 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">25 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> The Husband in person and unrepresented; Tan Mao Lin (Jacque Law LLC) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XSD — XSE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">25 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 1394 of 2024 (“SS 1394”) was the Wife’s application for a PPO against her Husband. I heard the trial and delivered judgment, allowing the Wife’s application in SS 1394. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed in her application, the Wife had to establish, on a balance of probabilities whether her Husband had committed family violence or whether her Husband was likely to commit family violence on her. The definition of family violence is set out in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 and includes:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In addition, the Wife must also establish, on a balance of probabilities, the necessity for a PPO. The crux of the inquiry here is that of a risk assessment. In other words, the court must consider the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence on the Wife in the future: see <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife’s complaint in SS 1394 revolves around an incident which took place on 22 July 2024. There was a dispute between the Wife and the Husband over the air conditioning. The Wife had turned to walk away. She alleges that the Husband pushed her. She fell onto her bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In his statement,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> the Husband admits that he lost control and pushed her at her back. He said he was tired after not having slept. His statement, that he had lost control, and pushed the Wife at her back, is again repeated in a document which he had filed containing his comments on the Wife’s affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I do not accept the Husband’s account, which he had given, in the course of his testimony, that he too had turned away as the Wife was turning away, and that when he did so, his hand had made contact with the Wife. His testimony given on the stand directly contradicts what he had previously stated in his statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> He was given the opportunity to clarify this discrepancy, but did not do so. I find that his version of events, that he had in the course of turning away from the Wife, swung his hand which made contact with her, was an attempt to downplay what he had actually done to the Wife in this incident on 22 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Having found that the Husband did lose control in that incident and pushed the Wife at her back, such an act, in my judgment, comes within the definition of family violence specifically limb (b) (<em>i.e.</em>, an act that causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I also found that the Husband was likely to commit family violence against the Wife. For example, his daughter had testified that:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"16.94%\"><col width=\"83.06%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright.

So, what I can recall is he would call her names, he would demean her, he would criticise her, they will get into an argumentative match, and most of the time will be like a one-way conversation from his side. And---and then when it gets too heated, that’s when he will like resort to like physical like violence like laying his hand on her, such as like pushing her, and then there’ll be like slamming of the walls and storming around the house</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In addition to the daughter’s testimony, there was also the Husband’s own account of events. He described what had taken place when he had gone with the Wife on a tour to Eastern Europe sometime in 2019. He said the Wife had forgotten to close the hotel door. This made him upset. He was concerned that their belongings could be stolen. His response, however, is telling. Instead of settling what was, and what should have been, a private dispute between him and his Wife, he chose to make remarks to the rest of the tour group.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There is also the Husband’s evidence of what he calls a “shadow”. This is the Husband’s term for a group of people, or a force that he says, is influencing the Wife to act against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The inference which I draw from these three examples that I have cited, is that the Husband obviously views the Wife in a negative light, and even that is perhaps, somewhat of an understatement. In addition, I find that the Husband is also prone to outbursts and does not appear to have a healthy way of handling disputes or disagreements with his Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     To sum up I have concluded thus far that the Husband did commit an act of family violence against Wife in the incident on 22 July 2024. I have also found it likely that the Husband will commit family violence against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It was noted in <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39], that once the court has found it likely that a respondent will commit family violence against a complainant, it logically follows that a PPO is presumptively necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Leaving aside any presumption, I am satisfied, on the evidence before me, that a PPO is indeed necessary. Both the Wife and the Husband are still living together in the same flat. That they continue to share a common space will only provide fertile ground for further disputes to arise between the two of them. But beyond this, as I had earlier noted, the negative light in which the Husband views his Wife, their unhappy relationship, as well as how the Husband chooses to react when he is upset with his Wife are all factors that point towards, and reinforce the necessity of ordering a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I therefore granted the Wife’s application in SS 1394 for a PPO. In addition, I also ordered both parties to attend counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     As for costs, counsel for the Wife, Mr Tan, argued that because the Wife had succeeded in her application, costs should be fixed at $15,000 in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To justify the quantum of costs being fixed at $15,000, Mr Tan referred me to the case of <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) where the court had fixed costs at $5000. Mr Tan argued that the length of the trial before me (which was much longer than the hearing in <em>XFL</em>), the number of witnesses, and the Husband’s conduct were all factors justifying asking for costs in the quantum of $15,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Husband, however, disagreed with Mr Tan’s submission that he should have to pay costs of $15,000 to the Wife. He gave several vague reasons which ranged from being financially unable to pay such costs as he could not expect any support from his children, to the fact that he was dissatisfied with my decision to grant his Wife the PPO she sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Having considered parties’ arguments on costs, I ordered that costs be fixed at $14,000 (all-in). The starting point is that a successful party is entitled to costs. Given that the Wife had succeeded in her application, she was entitled to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I saw no reason to exercise my discretion to depart from this starting point. In fixing costs at $14,000, I took into account, amongst other factors, the length of the trial, the number of witnesses and the conduct of parties. I also took into consideration the fact that there was a delay in the hearing of this matter. The trial had originally come up for hearing before me on 2<sup>nd</sup> October 2024. That hearing had to be adjourned because Mr Tan had just been appointed on the 26<sup>th</sup> of September 2024 to act for the Wife, and thus required time to take instructions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In particular, I would highlight that the Husband’s conduct was a factor that justified the award of a higher quantum of costs. To give an example, the Husband had, on the first day of trial, prior to the lunch break, said that he might also commit suicide.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given this, arrangements were made for a court counsellor to speak with the Husband. The Husband, however, shouted at the court counsellor and refused to engage with her.

Such was the relationship between them that they both took out the following applications against each other:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 1739/2024 was XRX’s application against XRY. She sought a personal protection order (“PPO”) against XRY, as well as a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) to exclude B from the matrimonial flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_1-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 1847/2024 was XRY’s application against XRX. She sought a PPO against XRX.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial of this matter over two tranches. XRX acted in person. B was represented by Ms Mary Ong (“Ms Ong”) and Mr Genesis Shen (“Mr Shen”). Judgment was reserved. Written submissions were filed. A hearing was fixed on 28 July 2025 for my decision to be given.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On the day my decision was to be handed down, Ms Ong’s secretary sent an email to court. There were three cases attached to that email. I was asked to take those three cases into account in deciding the two applications before me. XRX did not receive a copy of this email. It had been sent to her old email address instead of her current email address.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       As I explained to parties, even if I took these three cases into account, they would not, and indeed, did not affect my decision. That was because none of the three cases stood for the proposition for which they were cited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The first case was a decision by District Judge Kow Keng Siong (“DJ Kow”) in <em>XMZ v XZA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33304-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 60</a>. Ms Ong had cited this case for what DJ Kow had said at paragraphs 66 and 67. She argued that these two paragraphs stood for the broader proposition that the fact that parties are no longer living together does not mean that a PPO is not necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       This was what DJ Kow had said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">66    Finally, the Wife submitted that a PPO is not necessary because the Husband had moved out of the matrimonial home.<sup>[</sup><sup>note: 61]</sup></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">67    I am not persuaded by this submission. The fact that the parties are no longer residing together does not mean that family violence in the future is unlikely. In the present case, I note that the Wife appears to have a controlling personality and to tend to make inflammatory remarks towards the Husband over WhatsApp. This is evident, for instance, in the WhatsApp exchanges between the parties on 28 July 2023. The background to this exchange has already been set out in [5] to [16] above.<sup>[</sup><sup>note: 62] </sup>To recap –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The Husband told the Wife that her punishment of the son was unduly harsh – considering that it was just spelling. He had requested the Wife not to “overreact”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Despite the fact that the tone in the Husband’s messages was measured, the Wife responded with a barrage of accusatory statements. This included (i) asserting that the son’s poor performance was “definitely” due to the Husband’s “mistakes” (Message at 10.59 am), (ii) telling him “Don’t be stupid” (Message at 11.11 am), (iii) calling him an “irresponsible father who focus on money alone” (Message at 11.12 am), and (iv) scolding him, “shame on you” (Message at 11.15 am).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Ms Ong’s submission overlooks what DJ Kow then went on to say in that judgment. DJ Kow had found that, although parties were no longer living together, there was still a likelihood of family violence being committed because of the inflammatory remarks the Wife would make to the Husband over WhatsApp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       It was thus clear to me that DJ Kow was making a finding on the facts before him, and not laying down a broader proposition. I would also add that the facts before DJ Kow were, as will be apparent from my judgment, quite different from the present case before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The second case which Ms Ong had cited was one of my earlier decisions in <em>XMN v XMO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33260-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 54</a>. Ms Ong cited it for the proposition that “once family violence had been committed, there was a legal presumption that family violence is likely to be committed again in the future”. She referred to paragraph 17 of that judgment:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">17    Having found that the Husband was indeed likely to commit family violence, I turned to consider whether it was necessary to grant the PPO. In this vein, the law also says that once it is found that the Respondent is likely to commit family violence, a PPO is presumptively necessary: <em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [121] citing <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [21(a)] citing <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a> at [39].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     That was not what I had said in that judgment. The presumption I was referring to in that case was that in cases where the court finds that the respondent is likely to commit family violence, there is a presumption that a PPO is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The third case Ms Ong cited was <em>Lai Kwok Kin v Teo Zien Jackson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25309-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 5 SLR 389</a>. She cited it for the same proposition – that once family violence had been committed, there was a legal presumption that family violence is likely to be committed again in the future. I did not understand the High Court to be laying down such a proposition in that case: see <em>Lai Kwok Kin</em> at [40] – [52].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I turn now to set out the reasons for my decision, beginning with the applicable legal principles. As a preliminary point, both SS 1739 and 1847 were commenced prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2025. The applicable legislative provisions are to be found in the version of the Women’s Charter that was in force prior to 2<sup>nd</sup> January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In this connection, an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, the following two requirements, in order to obtain a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     First, that an act of family violence had been committed against the person sought to be protected, or that it was likely that family violence would be committed against the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Second, that it was necessary for the protection of that family member that a PPO be granted. In assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court essentially undertakes a risk assessment as to the likelihood of family violence being committed in the future: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19] – [21]; <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a> at [46]. In assessing the risk of family violence being committed in the future, the court considers factors such as the reasons for the family violence, whether the acts of family violence were recent occurrences, whether the family violence is a one-off occurrence, and whether there has been a material change in the parties’ living circumstances: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Apart from this, it is also important to note that such orders (<em>ie</em>, a PPO or a DEO) are meant to protect (<em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]). They are certainly not intended to be a tool to punish respondents for having committed acts family violence in the past. That is why applicants seeking a PPO must also demonstrate, to the court, that such an order is indeed necessary for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In this connection, the fatal flaw running through both applications in SS 1739 and 1847 is that neither XRX, nor XRY, have proven that it is indeed necessary for the court to order a PPO for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     XRX argued in her written submissions that it was necessary for her to be granted a PPO so that she will be able to “live without fear” and “sleep without anxiety” whilst rebuilding her “emotional stability” as she attempted to move on with her life after her divorce with her husband (“C”) had been finalised. XRX had also argued that any physical distance between her and XRY does not “erase the emotional control or the potential for ongoing harm”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     On the other hand, Ms Ong and Mr Shen argued that a PPO was necessary given the fact that XRY was 84 years old, and in a frail physical state, and to allow XRY to have a peace of mind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     None of the reasons given were good reasons as to why a PPO was necessary for the protection of either XRX or XRY. For one, while a PPO may have the effect of giving the protected person a peace of mind, that is not the purpose for which a PPO is granted. This is especially since there are serious consequences that may follow in the event a PPO is breached: see s 65(8) of the Women’s Charter 1961 which makes it clear that the breach of a PPO is an offence punishable by a jail term and/or a fine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Insofar as XRX suggests that a PPO was necessary to help her overcome the trauma and anxiety she had suffered from XRY’s alleged emotional control over her – I would observe that a PPO is not a balm to any wounds (both psychological or physical) that survivors of family violence may have endured. Healing will have to be found elsewhere. The point of such orders is to provide victims of family violence with a shield against future abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Insofar as XRX argues that a PPO is necessary, notwithstanding any physical separation between herself and XRY, I do not find that to be the case on the shape of the evidence before me. It was apparent, from the incidents that both XRX and XRY have complained of, that the friction and unhappiness between them arose from the both of them having shared a common space. After all, the incidents that both XRX and XRY had complained of occurred during a period of time where XRY lived together with XRX and C’s family and helped look after the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     That reality has since changed. Both XRX and XRY have moved out. They no longer share a common space. This physical separation between the two of them would minimise opportunities for further interaction, thereby depriving them of any fuel for further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Given that neither XRX, nor XRY, have proven the necessity requirement, it follows that their respective applications for a PPO in SS 1739 and 1847 must fail. Further, given that no PPO had been granted, XRX’s application for a DEO is also dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     As for costs, Ms Ong argued that costs should be fixed at $5000, to be paid by XRX to XRY. On the other hand, XRX argued that parties should each bear their own costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Given that neither party had succeeded in their respective application, I made no order as to costs for both applications.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Division of matrimonial assets – Variation of consent order"],"date":"2025-09-19","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OADV 125 of 2025","title":"XRO v XRP","citation":"[2025] SGFC 99","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33884-SSP.xml","counsel":["Ms Amy Lim (Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Applicant","Mr Loo Liang Zhi (Sterling Law Corporation) for the Respondent"],"timestamp":"2025-09-29T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XRO v XRP</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XRO <em>v</em> XRP </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33884-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 99</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">FC/OADV 125 of 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Ms Amy Lim (Amy Lim Law Practice) for the Applicant; Mr Loo Liang Zhi (Sterling Law Corporation) for the Respondent </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XRO — XRP </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division of matrimonial assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Variation of consent order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties were married in August 2010 and have 2 children, A and B.

The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">a.    To make full payment of the outstanding housing loan to the bank.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">b.    To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">c.    The balance sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 70% to the Applicant and 30% to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">d.    Parties shall pay the requisite CPF refunds in accordance with applicable CPF Rules and Regulations to their CPF accounts from their respective share of the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">e.    In the event that party's share of the sale proceeds are insufficient to pay the required CPF refunds to his/her own CPF accounts, that party shall be responsible for topping up the shortfall in cash to his/her own CPF account in one lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">f.    The Applicant shall have sole conduct of the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Respondent also sought that the Respondent shall pay the Applicant the difference between S$1.58m and the sale price, should the eventual sale price of the Property 2 fall below S$1.58m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Applicant filed the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Affidavit in support of application filed on 25 February 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Supporting affidavit filed on 3 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     2nd supporting affidavit filed on 18 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Respondent filed his affidavit in reply on 17 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Parties Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Applicant</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Applicant provided the following reasons for the variation for Property 1:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>c.     Applicant wished to purchase the Respondent’s 50% share to avoid similar disputes, ensured that he would receive his fair share without incurring additional costs, delays and uncertainties and provide a clear break for parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>d.     Applicant would like to be able to determine its future use.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Applicant provided the following reason for the variation of the order for Property 2:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>e.     She was solely responsible for managing it, including securing tenants, coordinating with agents, handling replacements, overseeing renovations, managing legal matters and payment of management and strata fees and property tax.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_f\"></a>f.     The Respondent only covered 30% of the monetary shortfalls and did not contribute time and effort to its management. As of 31 January 2025, there was an outstanding loan of $652,867.01. There had been financial shortfalls each month amounting to about $650 per month or $7,800 per year for which she had to bear 70% of the amount. The loss placed a significant financial strain on her, depleting her resources month after month. Selling it aligned with the terms of the interim judgment and it was prudent to have it sold. The current lease would expire in September 2025. She had received a favourable offer for $1.58 million and wished to proceed with the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_g\"></a>g.     The Respondent’s refusal was impractical, inequitable and inconsistent with the terms of interim judgement which gave the Applicant the predominant financial interest in its sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_h\"></a>h.     Applicant also wanted to reinvest and utilize funds that would benefit her and the children, example, funding the children’s private education. After the sale, she could establish a trust independently. The Respondent had not authority to dictate how she managed her share.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Respondent</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Respondent disagreed with the variation application in respect of the two properties as the parties intended to preserve the properties for the children’s future. The order provided these to be gifts to them if not sold. He proposed that if sold the proceeds should be placed in a trust or custodial accounts for the children financial needs. Alternatively, the properties should be maintained for their potential appreciation in value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The counsel for each party submitted written submissions and the matters set out below at the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On behalf of the Applicant:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_i\"></a>i.     in respect of Property 1, she wished to have the property bought over at market value based on valuation by an independent valuer;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_j\"></a>j.     in respect of Property 2, the clause was unworkable as it did not state when the property was to be sold and suggested that this should be by agreement. It was reiterated that the rental income was insufficient for the parties to hold on to the property. The property should be sold for parties to have a clean break.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_k\"></a>k.     In respect of Property 2 it was pointed out that though the clause provided for the proceeds to be divided 70:30 in favour of the Applicant, there was a dispute as to whether the division should be before or after CPF refunds<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. The Applicant sought to vary the sequence of the CPF refunds such that these refunds were made after the division of the proceeds of sale based on 70:30 apportionment in favour of the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_l\"></a>l.     The Applicant’s counsel submitted that the Applicant had wanted to have the CPF refunded after division. In view of that she had agreed to the following “adjustment” clause which reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">In the event the amount refunded to the Respondent 's CPF account exceeds 30% of the sale proceeds less Items (a) and (b), the Respondent shall pay the Applicant a sum equivalent to the said difference.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Applicant’s counsel explained that when the order was agreed, the property was worth about $1 million<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>. However, the clause did not contemplate a situation when the property value and sale price would significantly appreciate. Counsel also pointed out that there was a separation deed contemplated and other surrounding circumstances which supported the Applicant’s contention that the parties intended for the division of proceeds be 70:30 before CPF refunds in favour of the Applicant. One of the circumstances concerned the Applicant agreeing to the parties’ overseas properties be transferred to the Respondent without any compensation made to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     On behalf of the Respondent, it was also submitted that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_m\"></a>m.     It was dangerous to decipher parties’ intention which led to the consent order. What was evident was that parties took at least one month to decide on the matter and what parties had contemporaneously agreed to were as set out in the court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_n\"></a>n.     The effects of the variation application for Property 2, if allowed were different from those consented to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     In deciding the application , the legal provisions and authorities set out below were considered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Under sections 112(1) and 112(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961, the Court has the power to vary the orders for division of assets. The provisions read:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112.—(1)    The court has power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    The court may, at any time it thinks fit, extend, vary, revoke or discharge any order made under this section, and may vary any term or condition upon or subject to which any such order has been made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In relation to orders made by consent, in <em>XNG v XNH</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33284-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGHCF 32</a> the Court stated (at [9]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A consent order occupies a slightly higher elevation of authority because it is an order that both parties have forged together. It has the additional alloy of a contract and, therefore, more is required before a court will vary the order in question. It will not be enough to show that a consent appears unjust. This is because justice between the parties is sometimes a matter between them, and a court may not be able to revise an agreement entered into between parties who have decided in their wisdom how much to give and how much to take from each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The principles to be applied for variation of ancillary orders are set out by the Court of Appeal’s case of <em>AYM v AYL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGCA 0068.xml')\">[2012] SGCA 68</a>. The Court of Appeal also clarified the threshold required for a court to intervene and vary orders relating to the division of matrimonial assets. At [23] the Court made it clear that there should be a “fundamental importance of finality” which applies in the context of division of assets. The Court would make, inter alia, the necessary variations to an order for division only when the order was unworkable or has become unworkable (but before it has been fully effected or implemented). There could be situations where a court order has become unworkable as a result of new circumstances which have arisen. However, the change in question must be “very rare and very extreme” (at [26]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In relation to parties who are legally represented, in <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19150-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 41</a>, the Court of Appeal stated that any agreement in relation to the issue of division of assets which has been freely and voluntarily entered into by the parties upon legal advice should be almost determinative of the outcome and the role of the court “is greatly circumscribed”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Reasons for dismissal </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Applicant’s application was dismissed for the reasons set out below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In respect of Property 1, as mentioned above, the Applicant wished to purchase the Respondent’s 50% share to avoid similar disputes, ensured that he would receive his fair share without incurring additional costs, delays and uncertainties and provide a clear break for parties. The Applicant would like to be able to determine its future use.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I was of the view that the above reasons did not amount to a material or radical change in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In respect of Property 2, the Applicant main reason for seeking a variation was that she had been suffering shortfalls in the net income received of $650 per month. Her 70% share of this amount came up to $455 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Applicant had agreed to take on the obligation to maintain the property and in return, 70% of the net income would be retained by her whilst the remaining 30% be the Respondent’s share if there had been net profit. Any net loss would have to be shared in the same proportion. As the property was to be rented out, she would have anticipated that there would be occasions where the property would be vacant or rented at a loss in which case, a net loss was to be expected . I did not find that the $455 she had to incur each month caused a financial burden on her as claimed .</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     For a court to vary an ancillary order, it could also be shown that the order was unworkable. I was of the view this was not the case here for both properties. The order has been in operation for 5 years. In these 5 years, the properties had increased in value and to continue maintaining the properties, the Applicant had adhered to what had been agreed. It is not open to her now to claim that the order had been unworkable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I was also of the view that the reasons given were not sufficient to amount to a radical or material change in the circumstances in respect of Property 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In addition to the above reasons, I was of the view that variation of the order should not be allowed for the following additional reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The real effect of the varying clause 2 in respect of Property 2 was that the Respondent would be disadvantaged if the division of the proceeds were made before CPF refunds. This would be an injustice to the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The order was made with the consent of the parties. The court in <em>XNG v XNH</em> stated that it would not be enough to show that a consent appears unjust. While the Applicant claimed that the effect of the division after the sale of Property 2 would mean she would be receiving a lesser share than she had anticipated, this is a matter between the parties and, using the words of the court in XNG’s case, the court “may not be able to revise an agreement entered into between parties who have decided in their wisdom how much to give and how much to take from each other.”. I was of the view the Applicant would have to stand by what she had agreed to in the consent orders made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Applicant was legally represented in the proceedings involving the division of the ancillary matters and would have been advised on the implications of the order she has consented to. While the Applicant had explained that the clauses, including the adjustment clauses were made on the basis that there was to be either a loss or no increase in the value of properties, there was no reason why the Applicant could not have insisted or provided for a separate adjustment clause in the event that the properties increase in value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The variation sought to have the two properties sold would detract from the parties’ original intention which was to have the 2 properties gifted to the 2 children if not sold. There was no reason for the departure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion and costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     For the reasons given, the application was dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Respondent estimated the disbursements incurred to be in the region of $800 to $1,000. The sum of $4,000 was sought by the Respondent while the Applicant proposed $1,000 as there was only 1 reply affidavit filed by the Respondent. Having regards to the work done to resist the application, I fixed cost of $2,500 to be paid to the Respondent.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This was in relation to Clause 2) for Property 2, specifically: “(c) To make the requisite CPF refunds to parties' respective CPF accounts; (d) The net proceeds shall be divided at 70% to the Applicant and 30% to the Respondent”.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Paragraph 54 of Applicant’s written submissions.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child"],"date":"2025-09-04","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Maintenance Summons No 1997 of 2024","title":"XRF v XRE","citation":"[2025] SGFC 96","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33797-SSP.xml","counsel":["Sean Muhammad Marican (M M Marican & Co) for the Applicant","The Respondent in person and unrepresented."],"timestamp":"2025-09-10T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Maryam Hasanah Rozlan","html":"<root><head><title>XRF v XRE</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XRF <em>v</em> XRE </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33797-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 96</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Maintenance Summons No 1997 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">04 September 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Maryam Hasanah Rozlan </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Sean Muhammad Marican (M M Marican &amp; Co) for the Applicant; The Respondent in person and unrepresented. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XRF — XRE </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">4 September 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Maryam Hasanah Rozlan:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is an application by the complainant Mother (the “Mother”) for maintenance to be paid by the respondent Father (the “Father”) for the parties’ five children. The parties are divorced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The application was filed on 6 September 2024. The Mother was represented by counsel in these proceedings, while the Father was in person. Having heard the parties’ evidence and submissions on 30 April 2025 and 19 May 2025, I reserved my decision to 26 May 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I found that the Father had neglected to provide reasonable maintenance for the five children and therefore made maintenance orders. I set out the full grounds of my decision below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The parties are 36 years old. They were married for 13 years. In that time, they had five children, now aged 12, 10, 8, 6 and 5 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>The parties were divorced pursuant to a decree granted by the Syariah Court on 31 January 2024. The orders on the ancillary matters were made by consent. The parties were given joint custody of the five children, with care and control of the children to the Mother. The Father was given reasonable access to the children, including overnight access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Mother waived her claims to <em>nafkah iddah</em> and <em>mutaah</em> in the divorce. In respect of the matrimonial assets, the parties’ matrimonial flat (the “Flat”) was to be transferred to the Mother with no CPF refunds made to the Father’s CPF account and the parties were to retain all other assets in their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       After the divorce, the Mother remarried. The children continued living with her in the Flat. Meanwhile, the Father moved in with his parents and brother. Though the parties had arranged for the Father to have weekly day access with the children, he was not always able to exercise access due to the demands of his job. On the average, he was able to see the children around three times a month. This usually took place on Sundays, from 8.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Legal principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Section 68 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“WC”) encodes the duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of their children. Section 69 of the WC confers on the court the power to make a maintenance order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Section 69(2) of the WC sets the legal threshold a complainant must satisfy before the court makes a maintenance order. Under this provision, the Mother must first prove that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children. There are two aspects to this enquiry. First, an assessment of what comprises “reasonable maintenance” as a monetary sum based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Second, an enquiry as to whether reasonable provision had been made for such maintenance (<em>UHA v UHB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24410-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 666</a> (“<em>UHA</em>”) at [44]-[45]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The court may consider the question of “reasonableness” in several ways, such as the reasonableness of the expenses in question, whether one party reasonably communicated the needs or expenses to the other party, and whether the paying party used a reasonable mode of provision of maintenance (<em>UHA</em> at [46]-[50]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     When assessing the reasonableness of the expenses, the law does not require that every expense be proved by receipts or assessed on specific values, as if on a reimbursement exercise. However, more exceptional expenses, such as certain medical needs and costs, should be sufficiently supported by evidence (<em>UEB v UEC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a> (“<em>UEB</em>”) at [13]). The fact that an item of expenditure has been incurred by a party for the child does not necessarily mean it is a reasonable expense for which maintenance should be ordered. A unilateral decision by one party to incur such expenditure does not mean that the law will compel the other party to contribute to that expenditure (<em>WLE v WLF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29502-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 14</a> at [21]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     If neglect or refusal to provide reasonable maintenance is established, the court will then consider the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be paid and the mode of provision. In this regard, Section 69(4) of the WC sets out the factors that the court may consider when ordering maintenance. The court typically considers the financial needs of the children against the parties’ respective financial circumstances such as their income, means and expenses in assessing the appropriate amount of maintenance to be ordered. While both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and financial capabilities (<em>UHA</em> at [36]; <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [41]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     There were three broad issues to be determined in the present case:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, whether the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, if the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the children, what was the appropriate quantum of maintenance to be ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, if a maintenance order should be made, what mode of provision of maintenance would be reasonable in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     At the outset, I disallowed the claim for the outstanding mobile bill of $405.09 allegedly incurred by the Father. As counsel for the Mother conceded, this fell outside the scope of an application for child maintenance under Section 69(2) of the WC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Mother claimed that the Father had neglected or refused to provide reasonable maintenance for the five children since 5 June 2024. She sought from the Father monthly maintenance of $500.00 per child, totalling $2,500.00 per month. She also sought maintenance for the following additional expenses:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $350.00 per annum for Hari Raya Puasa expenses, based on a breakdown of $70.00 per child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $600.00 per annum for end-of-year school expenses, based on a breakdown of $200.00 for each of the older three children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A one-time reimbursement of $4,000.00 for the youngest child’s ongoing eczema treatment at a private clinic;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     A one-time reimbursement of $919.39 for 50% of the fees incurred by the oldest child when using a mobile phone application; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     A one-time reimbursement of $405.09 for an outstanding mobile phone bill allegedly incurred by the Father on a mobile phone line under the Mother’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Regular expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Mother asserted that the monthly expenses for the five children came up to $3,318.00,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> and submitted that this sum should be apportioned between the parties based on their relative incomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     She argued that the Father was financially capable of providing $2,500.00 per month for all five children and pointed to the fact that the Father had provided $2,250.00 per month from February 2024 to May 2024. She highlighted that the monthly maintenance provided by the Father had thereafter “<em>continuously declin[ed]</em>” as follows: $2,000.00 in June 2024, $1,750.00 in July 2024, $1,800.00 in August 2024, $1,500.00 in September 2024, $1,000.00 in October 2024 and $1,000.00 in November 2024. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father’s position was that $1,000.00 per month was adequate maintenance for the five children when they were in the Mother’s care. This was based on his calculation that the Mother only required $500.00 for food, based on a breakdown of $25.00 per day on weekdays, and $500.00 for miscellaneous expenses, given that some of the children’s school and education related expenses, including school meals, were covered by financial assistance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This maintenance of $1,000.00 per month was in addition to the monthly sum he directly paid toward the children when they were in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Father argued that maintenance for any necessary expenses incurred by the Mother above the sum of $1,000.00 per month should then be paid on a reimbursement basis. This was to ensure that the sums paid would be used for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> The Mother disagreed with receiving payments on a reimbursement basis given the acrimony between the parties, and argued that fixed monthly and annual payments were preferred.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Youngest child’s medical expenses </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     It was undisputed that the youngest child suffered from severe eczema. The Mother claimed that the child required special medical treatment for the condition, which could only be provided at a private clinic. The cost of the treatment, including medication, incurred from 31 August 2024 to 23 April 2025 amounted to $8,802.84.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> The Mother argued that the Father ought to cover at least half of the expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Mother explained that the child had previously received treatment at a public hospital which had been ineffective. The private clinic, on the other hand, offered a wet wrap therapy treatment that led to what she described as a “<em>massive improvement</em>” in the child’s condition.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> She claimed that the treatment was only offered by that clinic.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Father disputed the necessity of the treatment at the private clinic. He argued that the cost of the treatment was excessive and took the position that treatment at a government-subsidized hospital would have sufficed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Oldest child’s mobile phone expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Mother sought assistance from the Father for purchases made by the oldest child through the Google Play Store, totaling $1,838.78. The purchases were made on a mobile phone line under her name. She explained that she had not authorized the purchases and claimed to have unsuccessfully requested a refund.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Father acknowledged that this was not the first time the oldest child had incurred such an expense and shared that refunds were successfully obtained for previous transactions. However, he argued that he should not be responsible for the current expenses as they had been incurred when the oldest child was in the Mother’s care and control. In response, the Mother claimed that some of the transactions had taken place while the child was under the Father’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Father neglected or refused to pay reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The first issue was whether the Father had been paying a reasonable sum toward the children’s reasonable expenses, or whether there had been neglect or a refusal on his part to do so (<em>UHA</em> at [46]-[47]). This turned on my assessment of the parties’ respective financial circumstances and the children’s reasonable expenses as what constitutes a “reasonable sum” must be considered within this context.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ income, means and liabilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Mother worked as a procurement officer. Her net monthly salary from July 2024 to December 2024 was $2,280.27. She declared that she had two bank accounts: an account in her sole name with a balance of $1,398.53, and an account jointly owned with the third child, with a balance of $1,450.92 (as at December 2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Father worked as a traffic controller.

In arriving at these amounts, I took into consideration the fact that the three older children attending primary school were receiving financial assistance which covered miscellaneous fees, free textbooks, free school attire and subsidies for school meals. <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   Annual expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Mother had asked for maintenance for two types of annual expenses – end-of-year school expenses and Hari Raya related expenses. There appeared to be an overlap in the Mother’s claims for the children’s year-end school expenses and monthly school expenses as both seemed to cover ad-hoc school expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I therefore allocated a monthly sum of $20.00 per month ($240.00 per year) for each child for general school expenses in the above calculations of reasonable monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Given the parties’ financial circumstances, I was of the view that Hari Raya related expenses fell into the “good-to-have” category. There was no evidence before me to substantiate the quantum sought by the Mother. However, as the quantum and reasonableness of the expense itself was undisputed by the Father, I assessed $350.00 per annum to be a reasonable annual expense, to be jointly borne by the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   Youngest child’s medical expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     It was undisputed that the youngest child required medical treatment for her eczema condition. However, the treatment at the private clinic was an exceptional expense which ought to have been supported by evidence (<em>UEB</em> at [13]). Unfortunately, the evidence produced by the Mother to substantiate this expense was sorely lacking. Based on what I had before me, I concluded that the treatment at the private clinic was not a necessity, as the Mother had sought to argue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Though I accepted the Mother’s assertion that the youngest child benefitted from the wet wrap therapy at the private clinic, there was no objective medical evidence before me that the child required <em>that</em> specific treatment at <em>that</em> specific clinic, or that more cost-effective alternatives were unavailable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> Counsel for the Mother argued that the Mother would not have found it necessary to seek further treatment in private clinics if the public hospital had solved the problem. I found this argument to be entirely unhelpful and circular in its reasoning and did not give it much weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Mother asserted that the Father had agreed to bear part of the expense. The Father denied this. I did not accept the Mother’s assertion. First, it was inconsistent with her earlier claimed that she had attempted to communicate with the Father about the expense, but that he had “<em>totally ignored</em>” her. Second, the purported agreement was part of discussions during a mediation session which were without prejudice, as the Father pointed out. Third, the text messages the Mother relied on as proof of the agreement clearly showed that the Father had disagreed with the expense, citing his financial ability. The Mother had nonetheless unilaterally decided to proceed with the expenditure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given the foregoing, I found the total expense of $8,802.84 incurred by the Mother (as at 13 May 2025) for the child’s private clinic treatments to be excessive and did not think it reasonable for the Father to be obliged to pay 50% of this cost. The child’s treatments at the public hospital from 3 April 2024 to 7 August 2024, in comparison, only amounted to $596.99 in total.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> Using the cost of these public hospital treatments as a benchmark, I estimated that $150.00 per month would have been reasonable expense for the child’s treatments. For the 8-month period from 31 August 2024 to 23 April 2025, this would have amounted to a total of $1,200.00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Oldest child’s mobile phone expenses</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This was not a reasonable expense and could have been avoided with closer supervision of the child. The bills submitted by the Mother showed that the transactions took place over an extended period, from 29 March 2024 to 7 May 2024. No explanation was given by either party as to why this was allowed to continue, especially given it was a repeat occurrence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I agreed with the Father’s position that the parent in whose care the oldest child was at the time the transactions took place should be responsible for this expense. Neither party submitted any evidence as to who cared for the child when the transactions were made.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     Given the Father generally had care of the children on Sundays, I found that the Father should only be responsible for the transactions incurred on Sunday, 5 May 2024 which amounted to $264.95. The Mother should bear the responsibility for the costs of the remaining transactions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Reasonable maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having assessed the children’s reasonable expenses, I turned to the question of what constituted reasonable maintenance in the present case.

medical and school expenses on an ad-hoc or annual basis. In this regard, I found that additional provisions ought to be made for such ad-hoc expenses and made orders accordingly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Whether the Father had been paying a reasonable sum</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     It was undisputed that the Father had been paying the Mother monthly maintenance for the children. However, he had, by his own admission, gradually and unilaterally reduced the maintenance paid to the Mother since June 2024 to prioritize personal savings for himself.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> He paid $1,500.00 in September 2024 and thereafter paid $1,000.00 per month since October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In addition, the Father also directly covered some of the children’s expenses when they were in his care. Though this fact was undisputed, the parties disagreed on the quantum. The Father suggested in his oral evidence that these direct payments amounted to $565.00 per month. There was no documentary evidence supporting this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I was unconvinced that the Father spent $565.00 per month on the children when they were in his care. I found this to be overstated, given the parties’ financial circumstances. Moreover, by the Father’s own admission, the children were only with him two to three days per month, during which time the children sometimes had meals prepared at home by their grandmother. Even if I accepted the Father’s assertions, his total contributions would still fall below what I had assessed to be reasonable maintenance, as set out in the tables above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I was therefore satisfied that there had been a neglect or refusal to pay reasonable maintenance on the Father’s part since 6 September 2024 (when the application was filed) and that a maintenance order should accordingly be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Appropriate quantum of maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I turn now to the question of the appropriate quantum of maintenance that should be ordered.

In assessing the parties’ precise obligations, I considered the ratio of the parties’ income and the Father’s financial ability to pay the maintenance ordered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having reviewed the Father’s net monthly income and his own reasonable expenses, I found the Father to be financially capable of fully covering his proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses as set out above. Based on the estimates provided by the Father, his monthly expenses came up to about $3,046.67. However, this sum included a monthly allowance of $800.00 for his parents and $700.00 in monthly personal savings, both of which should not be prioritized over the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Having considered the Father’s evidence in totality, I assessed the Father’s own reasonable expenses to be approximately $1,190.67 per month. A breakdown of my assessment is set out at Annex 2. With the Father’s net monthly income of $5,109.56, the Father had more than enough to cover his proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses, as well as any additional expenses he may directly incur when the children are in his care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Backdating of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     As I had found that the Father had neglected or refused to pay reasonable maintenance since 6 September 2024, I considered whether backdated maintenance should be ordered. The court has a wide power to backdate maintenance to a date which it considers fair (<em>AMW v AMZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 3 SLR 0955.xml')\">[2011] 3 SLR 955</a> at [13]; <em>VOD v VOC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27188-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGHC(A) 6</a> at [141]-[145]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the monthly maintenance payments made by the Father to-date, I found it appropriate for the monthly sum of $2,085.00 to be backdated to 6 September 2024 i.e., when the present application was filed and the Father had reduced the monthly maintenance sum to $1,500.00 before subsequently reducing it further. After deducting the sums already paid by the Father, the total quantum of backdated maintenance amounted to $9,265.00 for a period of 9 months from 6 September 2024 to 3 June 2025. I found it reasonable for the Father to pay for this in instalments of $545.00 per month (17 instalments), which I assessed to be within his financial capability.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Reasonable mode of provision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     When a maintenance order is made, the mode of provision of maintenance should be reasonable. In the present case, I found that fixed payments on a monthly and annual basis were reasonable, with any additional expenses to be covered on a reimbursement basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I accepted the Mother’s submission that the provision of regular expenses on a reimbursement basis would be difficult, given the strained relationship between the parties. The parties appeared to disagree on even basic items such as purchasing shoes for the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Moreover, as the care and control parent who was managing the children around 90% of the time, the Mother should be allowed to allocate the regular maintenance sums she receives for the children as she deems appropriate within a budget, without having to account to the Father for every single expense (<em>UEB</em> at [13]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     The Father alleged in his closing submissions that the Mother was not transparent with her expenditure on the children or claims for maintenance. However, he did not provide any evidence of this. In any case, I found that any such transparency issue, even if made out, would be addressed by provisions for fixed payments towards the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders made</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Based on the figures and reasons given above, I ordered that the Father pay the Mother the following sums as maintenance for the children:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a\"></a>(a)     With effect from 4 June 2024, a monthly maintenance of $2,085.00 per month for the five children of the marriage, comprising:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $425.00 per month for each of the older three children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $380.00 per month for the fourth child; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $430.00 per month for the youngest child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_b\"></a>(b)     69% of the costs (not covered by financial assistance) related to year-end school expenses (i.e., schoolbooks, uniform, shoes, bags, water bottles, stationery) for any/all of the five children on a reimbursement basis;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_c\"></a>(c)     69% of the costs related to expenses for specialist medical consultations, treatments, and/or hospitalization at government-subsidized hospitals (including any related outpatient medical expenses) for any/all of the five children on a reimbursement basis;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_d\"></a>(d)     An annual sum of $240.00 for the five children ($48.00 per child) for Hari Raya related expenses;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Backdated maintenance as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       $9,265.00 as lump sum maintenance for the children for the period of 6 September 2024 to 3 June 2025, to be paid in equal instalments of $545.00 per month with effect from 4 June 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       $830.00 as a partial reimbursement of the costs related to the youngest child’s medical expenses; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_e-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       $264.95 as a partial reimbursement of the costs related to the oldest child’s mobile phone expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Counsel for the Mother sought costs of $500.00 to $750.00, on the basis that the Mother had largely won the proceedings. The Father disagreed, stating that he was unable to afford this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I made no orders as to costs. I did not agree with counsel’s position that the Mother had largely won the proceedings. Moreover, the proceedings were unnecessarily lengthened by delays on the Mother’s part, including the submission of new evidence during the trial when such evidence could have and should have been produced earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>___________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Annex 1: Children’s reasonable monthly expenses</p> <p

But that is not the language of family law. An insistence on asserting one’s hard-nosed legal rights may, invariably, result in acrimonious and intractable disputes. This case, as will soon be apparent, is a salutary reminder of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       This was a dispute between ex-spouses. Their divorce had been finalised when an order of court disposing of the ancillary matters was made on 31 March 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Parties, however, marked their return to court with the following cross-applications for personal protection orders (“PPO”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SSP 467 of 2025 (“SSP 467”) was the Mother’s application against the Father. She sought a PPO for herself and the two daughters (“C” and “D”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SSP 503 of 2025 (“SSP 503”) was Father’s application against the Mother. He sought a PPO for himself as well as C and D.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of both matters. The Wife was represented by Ms Tan Siew Kim and Ms Rupawalla (“Ms Tan”). The Husband represented himself. Judgment was reserved. I had directed that parties file written submissions. They did so. Judgment was delivered on 16 August 2025. I dismissed both applications. These are my reasons for doing so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There are three main issues to be decided in these two applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Mother should be granted a PPO against the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether the Father should be granted a PPO against the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether the two children, C<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and D, should be granted a PPO against both their parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Before turning to deal with these issues, I sketch out, in broad strokes, the applicable legal principles to such applications for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In his written submissions, the Father makes reference to the provisions of the Women’s Charter that were in force prior to the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       That cannot be right. Because both SSP 467 and 503 were taken out after the 2<sup>nd</sup> of January 2025, it is clear that the new legislative provisions relating to family violence apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Apart from referring me to provisions of the Women’s Charter that were inapplicable to the present applications, the Father had also cited a number of cases which he said stood for various propositions of law. The Father also submitted that some of these cases were analogous to the facts of the present case before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       While some of them, at first blush, are quite obviously fictitious cases given that the case names of Family Court are redacted, others appear, at first blush, to be legitimate cases. For ease of reference, I have set out below, a list of every single case that the Father had cited in his written submissions:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Huang v Lee</em> [2018] SGFC;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Lee Siew Kuen v Foo</em> [2020] SGFC;<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Re SS 1234/2019.

That is because the neutral citations in question actually belonged to other cases, as I have set out in the list above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     There were two possible explanations as to how these 14 cases, none of which appear to be legitimate cases, could have wormed their way into the Father’s written submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The first, and what I considered to be the likelier possibility, was that the Father had used generative artificial intelligence tools (“generative AI tools”) to assist him in preparing his written submissions. The use of such tools in proceedings before the Family Court is regulated by the guidelines set out in the Registrar’s Circular No. 1 of 2024 titled: “Guide on the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools by Court Users” (the “Guide”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> The Guide sets out principles relating to the use of generative AI tools in court proceedings, as well as a brief explanation of how such AI works.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In particular, the Guide emphasises that court users will remain responsible for all the content in their court documents and that they must ensure, amongst other things, that any AI generated output in their court documents is accurate and relevant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Guide also makes it clear that there will be consequences for non-compliance – this includes adverse costs orders being made, or that the material which had been submitted to court may be disregarded.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The second explanation was that the Father had deliberately cited these cases in an attempt to mislead the court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given this, I saw fit to afford the Father the opportunity to explain himself. My judgment in respect of both matters was supposed to be delivered on 29 July 2025. I vacated that hearing and saw parties in chambers. I provided them a list of the 14 cases, and explained to them that it appeared to me that none of these cases existed. I drew parties’ attention to the Guide and directed the Father to file an affidavit explaining the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     How his written submissions had been prepared, and specifically, whether he had used generative AI tools in preparing those submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     If he had used generative AI tools, he was to state how those tools were used.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To explain how he had obtained every single case cited in his written submissions, and to explain whether those cases existed (if at all).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father complied with my directions and filed his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> He stated that he had used ChatGPT to assist him in “identifying relevant local legal precedents”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He had done so by providing ChatGPT with a “detailed account” of the incidents in dispute.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> ChatGPT had provided an output, and he then proceeded to include all 14 proposed case citations in his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father confirmed that none of the cases he had cited exist.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> He also stated that he had failed to verify these cases before including them in his submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> Finally, the Father stated that while he was not aware of the Guide when he drafted his written submissions, he had since taken steps to familiarise himself with the Guide, and that he would undertake to confirm the accuracy and authenticity of all documents submitted to court in the future.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Apart from the Husband’s affidavit, Ms Rupawalla had also confirmed that none of these 14 cases that the Father had cited were genuine cases.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Given what the Father had stated in his affidavit, it was quite clear that I do not need to consider those cases cited in his submissions. In any event, the applicable legal principles are to be found in family violence provisions as set out in the Women’s Charter 1961. A plain reading of those provisions make it clear that in order to obtain a PPO, an applicant must establish the following two broad requirements on a balance of probabilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     First, it must be shown that the respondent had committed, or was likely to commit family violence against the person sought to be protected: s 60A(1)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Second, it must be shown that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected: s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition to this, and notwithstanding the legislative amendments to the provisions of the Women’s Charter that deal with family violence, it goes without saying that the purpose of a PPO is not to punish acts of family violence, but rather, to protect victims of family violence (see <em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [1]). These orders are prospective. They are made with a view to breaking the cycle of domestic abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The main incidents in both these applications took place on the 1st and 5th of March 2025. These incidents arose out of the access arrangements for the two children. The Father was evidently frustrated by what he perceived to be the Mother’s attempt to deny him access to the children in spite of the court order that was made. The Mother evidently felt justified in acting the way she did on the basis that she, as well as the children, felt threatened by how the Father had behaved during his period of access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Video recordings of both incidents on the 1st and 5th of March were adduced as evidence by the Mother. They provide a view as to what had happened on that day and how parties had acted towards each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Insofar as the incident on the 1st of March is concerned, I did not find that either the Father or the Mother had committed family violence on each other. The footage, which was taken from a CCTV, shows that both the Father and the Mother were engaged in a tug of war over their eldest child who was, unfortunately, caught up in the center of their dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As far as I could tell from the CCTV footage, neither the Father nor the Mother had acted aggressively towards the other, though the Father did seem visibly more frustrated than the Mother. One might quite justifiably conclude that the actions of both the Father and the Mother were less than ideal given that their eldest child (“C”) was caught in the crossfire. Their actions, however, did not, in my judgment, cross the line and stray into the realm of either physical abuse, or emotional and/or psychological abuse. For one, although both the Mother and Father were engaged in a tug of war, their actions quite clearly showed that neither of them were at risk of suffering physical pain or personal injury despite the fact that they were engaged in a physical struggle over the child. I would also add that insofar as the Father claimed that the Mother had scratched him during the tussle over their eldest child, he had not put anything before me to prove the severity of these scratches. In short, the Father had not proved that the Mother had, by scratching him in the tussle, caused him physical pain such that her actions could conceivably fall within the definition of physical abuse as is set out in s 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Insofar as the Father and the Mother both point the finger at each other and allege that they had suffered emotional and/or psychological abuse in both incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025, I also do not find that to be the case. Parties were clearly upset, frustrated, and unhappy with each other. That is, however, an entirely reasonable and natural reaction to have when one finds themselves embroiled in a dispute, especially over matters that are close to one’s heart. But that cannot, and in my judgment – does not, fall within the definition of emotional and/or psychological abuse as is set out in s 58B(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     For completeness, I do not find that either the Father, or the Mother, were likely to commit family violence on each other. The evidence shows that the both of them are clearly unhappy with each other. But that alone does not necessarily point to the likelihood of them committing family violence on each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The both of them had also dredged up incidents from the time when they were still married. Even if I accepted that their respective accounts were true, I did not find that these incidents established a present pattern of conduct, on either the part of the Father, or the Mother, that pointed to the likelihood of them committing family violence on each other. That is because these incidents occurred whilst parties were still married. The situation now is rather different given that parties have gone their separate ways and that some time has passed since their divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I also find that neither the Mother, nor the Father, had committed family violence on the two children. Both the Mother and the Father sought to highlight, and emphasise, the alleged trauma both children had experienced as a result of being caught up in the incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     There can be little doubt that both the children were, in all likelihood, distressed from being embroiled in their parents’ dispute. However, I did not think it was open to either the Mother, or the Father, to rely on this to accuse each other of having committed emotional and/or psychological abuse on the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For one, it was clear to me that the both of them felt justified in acting in the way they did in both incidents. The Mother justified her actions on the need to protect herself and the children from the Father. The Father, on the other hand, insisted on exercising his access rights pursuant to the court order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     As a result, neither the Mother, nor the Father, could find common ground to resolve their differences in a manner that would not adversely impact the children. That was what the both of them could have, and should have, done, or at the very least – attempted to do. In my judgment, the both of them must take some personal responsibility for how the incidents on 1st and 5th of March had escalated and adversely impacted both their children. It therefore does not lie in their mouth to now claim that the way the other party had behaved in those two incidents had amounted to emotional and/or psychological abuse on both the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     As a final point, I do not find that either the Father, or the Mother, were likely to commit family violence on the two children. I found that the both of them do, in their own way, care for their children – that much was evident from the Mother’s testimony as well as the videos which the Father had submitted to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Having concluded that neither the Father or the Mother had committed, or were likely to commit family violence on each other or the children, the result is that their respective applications for a PPO must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In any event, I did not find it necessary to order a PPO for either the Father or the Mother’s own protection. In assessing the necessity of a PPO, the court considers the risk of family violence being committed in the future. This is in line with the whole point of a PPO which is, as I have pointed out, a forward-looking order that is meant to shield parties from future abuse and not meant to punish past acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It was clear to me in the present case that the recent incidents between the Father and the Mother had arisen because of problems relating to the Father’s access to the two children. As I had mentioned, both the Father and the Mother clearly felt that their actions were justified. This led to the both of them clashing over the access arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     Notwithstanding the incidents that had taken place, the reality of the situation is that there was a clear degree of separation between both the Father and the Mother. It was evident to me that the both of them would only come into contact with each other when the children are involved. It was also evident to me, from the incidents on the 1st and 5th of March 2025, that other parties, namely their own parents, would be present when they both come into contact with each other, and would step in to attempt to break up any argument between the two of them. Given these facts, there is, in my judgment, a low risk of the Father and the Mother committing family violence on each other. I therefore found that it was not necessary to order a PPO for their own protection or personal safety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I also found that it was not necessary to order a PPO in favour of the children to protect them from the Father and the Mother. For one, as I have mentioned earlier, I did find that the Mother and the Father do care for both children in their own way. The reality of the situation, as I have found, was that any adverse impact on the children arose precisely because both parents insisted on having things done in their own uncompromising way. Although there may continue to be problems arising from access arrangements going forwards, that is an issue for both the Father and the Mother to work through on their own in a sensible and mature way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Given what I had set out above, I dismissed both applications in SSP 467 and 503 of 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     On the issue of costs, Ms Rupawalla submitted that while it was appropriate to make no order as to costs given that neither party had succeeded in their respective applications, I should order the Father to pay costs fixed at $5000 (all-in) to account for the work that had to be done in respect of the fake cases that the Father had submitted to court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Father, on the other hand, sought costs of $2000 to account for the costs he had incurred when he sought legal advice in preparing for both applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Given that neither party had succeeded in their respective applications, the starting point should be that there be no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I saw fit to depart from that starting point, taking into account the fake cases that the Father had cited. While I accepted that he had taken ownership of what he has done, the reality was that his actions required efforts to be undertaken, by Ms Rupawalla, to double check that none of the cases cited are legitimate cases. A hearing date also had to be vacated as a result. This must all be reflected by way of costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I therefore ordered the Father to pay costs, which I fixed at $1000 (all in) to the Mother by the 22nd of August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In addition to this order of costs, I was also minded to make further orders to guard against the citation of AI hallucinated material to the court. Specifically, I was minded to order that the Father, if he so chooses to represent himself in any future matter before the Family Courts, and should he use generative AI in preparing any document that is submitted to the courts for the purposes of proceedings, he must, accordingly, declare this in writing to the court and state that he has complied with the Guide.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I indicated this to both the Father, as well as Ms Rupawalla, and invited arguments from the both of them on this point, and whether any orders along the lines I had sketched out above (at [46]) should be made. Ms Rupawalla indicated that she did not have anything to add. The Father on the other hand, indicated that he was agreeable to such orders being made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I deemed it necessary to make such orders (at [46]) given what has transpired here in the present case. In a common law system such as ours, the citation of cases to the court plays an important role – especially considering the principles of <em>stare decisis</em> and <em>ratio decidendi</em> (see <em>eg</em>: Julius Stone, “The Ratio of the Ratio Decidendi” (1959) 22(6) Modern Law Review 597; A.L. Goodhart, “The Ratio Decidendi of a Case” (1959) 22(2) Modern Law Review 117; J.L. Montrose, “Ratio Decidendi and the House of Lords” (1957) 20(2) Modern Law Review 124; A.L. Goodhart, “Determining the Ratio Decidendi of a Case” (1930) 40(2) Yale Law Journal 161 for a discussion on determining the <em>ratio</em> of a case). In fact, that was <b><em>precisely</em></b> the reason why the Father had cited me those cases in his submissions – he sought to persuade me that the present case was materially similar to the facts of those cases, and so the outcome too, should be the same.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The corollary of this is that if common law is to continue operating in the modern age alongside technology such as generative AI, the courts must be able to take, at face value, the cases which parties have cited either in their written submissions or their bundle of authorities. The citation of fake or AI hallucinated cases to the courts thus has a deeply corrosive effect on the legal system. If there is a suspicion that the cases, or paragraphs from cases cited are not genuine, then time and effort will have to be spent checking the provenance and authenticity of the material which had been cited (see <em>May v Costaras</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('http://classic.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/sinosrch.cgi?results=200;query=au/cases/nsw/NSWCA/2025/178.html')\">[2025] NSWCA 178</a> at [12] citing <em>Ayinde v The London Borough of Haringey</em> [2025] EWHC 1383 (Admin) at [9]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I thus saw fit to order that the Father make the respective declarations to the Family Court in any future matter – this is especially since the Mother will, in all likelihood, be the respondent in any future application brought by the Father in the Family Courts, and so will be affected should the Father once again rely on the product of AI hallucinations. In that vein, it is, after all, well established that the court does have the inherent power to prevent an abuse of its own processes (see: <em>Tomolugen Holdings Ltd and another v Silica Investors Ltd and other appeals</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18407-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 1 SLR 373</a> at [188]; <em>Cheong Wei Chang v Lee Hsien Loong and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22781-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 326</a> at [65] <em>citing Wellmix Organics (International) Pte Ltd v Lau Yu Man</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 2 SLR(R) 0117.xml')\">[2006] 2 SLR(R) 117</a> at [81]; <em>FT Plumbing Construction Pte Ltd v Authentic Builder Pte Ltd and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21648-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCR 3</a> at [22] – [23]), and this extends to guarding against the citation of fake cases: <em>Bandla v Solicitors Regulation Authority</em> [2025] EWHC 1167 (Admin) at [53].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     To be clear, my order does not prohibit the Father from using generative AI – indeed, as the Guide states, the use of generative AI is not prohibited. Rather, the Father had to make the necessary declarations should he use generative AI to assist him in preparing his court documents. I considered this approach to be one that struck a fair balance between allowing the use of generative AI and ensuring that the court is not taken by surprise by the product of AI hallucinations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     As a final point, I must emphasise that the fact that the Father is self-represented in these proceedings does not absolve him of responsibility of ensuring that the information he had submitted to court is accurate. That much is also made clear by the Guide. In this connection, to the Father’s credit, he did fully accept responsibility for his actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     I concluded my judgment with a few words to both the Father and the Mother. The poet Kahil Gibran, in his poem “On Children”, wrote:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, Speak to us of Children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Your children are not your children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">They come through you but not from you,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may give them your love but not your thoughts,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For they have their own thoughts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may house their bodies but not their souls,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     It is clear to me that although your divorce has concluded, the both of you still bear many grievances towards each other. That is understandable. But you must think of the two children you have brought into this world. Being little, they will need the guidance and the wisdom of both their parents to show them the ways of the world. Work together to give them that. Do not let your emotions or preconceived notions or personal animosity with each other stand in the way of their developmental needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     By way of a brief postscript, after I had delivered my judgment, both the Father and Mother indicated that they would like to resume counselling in an attempt to improve the situation relating to the access arrangements, and actively took steps to do so. I was heartened by their efforts, and what appeared to be a genuine attempt by them to leave behind their unhappy past. I would strongly encourage them to stay the course.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Mother’s Written

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This case involves allegations of family violence committed against a young child who shows some signs of light autism. It raises several important issues which lie at the intersection of evidential principles and child protection. For instance, in what circumstances should a child witness be called to testify? How do differences in communication style and behaviour of the child witness in this case affect the assessment and weight of his testimony?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The applicant (“<b>Mother</b>”) and the respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) have two sons. The children were born in August 2014 (“<b>1<sup>st</sup> Son</b>”) and October 2016 (“<b>2<sup>nd</sup> Son</b>”). The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son shows some signs of light autism.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 7 July 2024, the Mother left the matrimonial home with the 1<sup>st</sup> Son after a domestic incident with the Father. She later found a shelter which took them in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Sometime after the Mother and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son had left the matrimonial home, the Father brought the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to stay with his mother (“<b>paternal grandmother</b>”) at her flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 17 September 2024, after his tuition class had ended at around 6.00 pm,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not proceed to his paternal grandmother’s flat. Instead, he returned to his matrimonial home by himself and approached a neighbour (“<b>Neighbour</b>”) for help. The Neighbour called the Mother, who promptly contacted the Police. When she arrived at the Neighbour’s unit, the Mother saw the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son with the Police. At or around 8.00 pm, the child was conveyed by ambulance to the hospital.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Child Protective Services were activated, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son remained in the hospital for about one month (until 15 October 2024). After his discharge, the child was placed in the Mother’s care.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 5 November 2024, the Father applied for sole custody, care and control of the children: OSG xxx/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 19 November 2024, the Mother applied for a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) to protect the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son from the Father: SS 2189/2024. This application is based on incidents that had allegedly occurred from around September 2024 to December 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       After considering the evidence and submissions, I granted the PPO application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on or before 17 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I shall begin with the first incident which had occurred on or before 17 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In her PPO application, the Mother stated that this incident involved “physical punishment and psychological abuse” against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In her affidavit, the Mother elaborated that at about 5.49 pm on 17 September 2024, she had received a message from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s tuition teacher that the child wanted to speak to her. When she contacted the child, he was crying. Shortly thereafter, she received a call from the Neighbour who informed her that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had gone to her unit to seek help: see [5] above. When the Mother arrived at the Neighbour’s unit, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son told the Police, “I want to go with Mommy” and “Dad and Grandma bully me”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the trial, the Mother added that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had also told the Police that the Father and paternal grandmother were very violent towards him and he could not stay with them anymore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Calling the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son as a witness</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s testimony is clearly important in determining whether the Father had committed family violence against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Mother did not have any personal knowledge of such violence. Her evidence about the violence is based on what the child had told her. Her evidence about the violence is clearly hearsay and is thus of limited value on its own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, there was no objective evidence (e.g. recordings) that could independently prove that the Father had committed family violence against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Despite the importance of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence, the Mother (who was self-represented at the material time) did not think of calling him to testify at the PPO trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Given (1) the centrality of the child’s testimony to the allegations of family violence and (2) his young age (he was about nine years old at the time of trial), I sought the parties’ views as to whether he should testify.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     After I had explained to the Mother the importance of direct evidence regarding the alleged family violence, she informed me readily that she would like the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to give evidence. She requested that he be allowed to do so in writing – as he had been showing some signs of light autism and sometimes struggled with oral communication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Counsel for the Father, Mr Clarence Lun, raised three concerns: (i) that the child’s evidence might delay the trial; (ii) that he might be unable to give clear evidence given his condition; and (iii) that his testimony might be coached.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     After considering the matter, I decided to allow the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to testify.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, an allegation of family violence against a child is a serious matter and must be investigated properly. If the allegation is borne out, then a PPO ought to be issued to protect the child. Conversely, if there is no evidence of family violence, then the respondent ought to be vindicated. This is especially so where there are pending custody or other proceedings relating to the child – as the allegation of family violence can have a material bearing on such proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is vital that a person sought to be protected by a PPO be given the opportunity to be heard. If a child can testify, then he/she should have a voice in the trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the law does not treat a child’s evidence as being inherently unreliable. The key question is not a witness’s age – but the child’s ability to understand questions and to provide intelligible answers. This principle applies equally where the child shows some signs of light autism. Whether such a witness can give credible and reliable evidence is a matter that can be assessed when he/she testifies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I informed the parties that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would be allowed to testify via Zoom from a separate room with a vulnerable witness support volunteer. The child would also be permitted to write out his answers, if he preferred.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> Additionally, I directed the Mother not to discuss with the child about his evidence in court. This would not only preserve the integrity of his evidence – but also avoid adding undue stress to him. She confirmed that she understood my directions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> The matter was then adjourned for the relevant arrangements to be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     On the day the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son was to give evidence, I proposed to the parties that (a) I sit in the same room as him, and (b) his evidence be transmitted live to the parties who remained in the courtroom. This would enable me to directly observe the child at all material times. The parties agreed to this arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     When the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son testified, I observed him to be alert – but reserved and non-verbal. He understood the questions posed to him, and answered them through gestures as well as by writing short but clear sentences in a notebook. For instance, he wrote that his favourite subject was Mathematics.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> The child did not answer some questions. In my view, this was due to his discomfort with the matters asked, and not because he did not understand them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     During the examination-in-chief, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son wrote down the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “Beat” – when asked whether the Father had done anything to him while they were staying with the paternal grandmother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “Very bad” – when asked what he thought of the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “He beat” – when asked why the Father was bad.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In cross-examination, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Shook his head when asked whether he had missed the Father.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Wrote “Yes” (and circled the word several times) when asked whether he was happy with the Mother.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Additionally, when asked which school level he was in when the beating took place, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son held up two fingers (indicating Primary Two).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> As he was in Primary Three in 2025,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> this meant that the beating incident would have occurred in 2024. This coincides with the events on 17 September 2024: see [5] and [10(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Father’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     After the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had completed his testimony, the Father gave evidence. He denied having beaten the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence disclosed the commission of family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence – if true – clearly establishes that the Father had beaten him, and that this had occurred in 2024 while they were staying at the paternal grandmother’s flat: see [18] to [20] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Lack of particulars regarding the family violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The child’s evidence however lacked particulars as to the number, date(s), and manner of the beating(s). Does this mean that the Mother had failed to discharge her burden of proof?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In my view, the answer is no. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the burden on the Mother is to prove on a <em>balance of probabilities</em> that “family violence [had] been committed or is likely to be committed” against the child: see s 65(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). In other words, the Mother is required to simply show that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence – that the Father had beaten him – is more likely to be true when compared to the latter’s denial of the beating(s).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the absence of details of the family violence <em>per se</em> does not negate the credibility and reliability of the child’s evidence – especially if, for instance, it is (i) clear in substance, (ii) supported by contemporaneous evidence, and (iii) corroborated by trauma symptoms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, and in any event, it is clear from s 65(1) that there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence has in fact been committed before a PPO can be granted. It is sufficient for the applicant to show – on a balance of probabilities – that such violence “<em>is likely to be committed</em> against a family member”: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [16] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, a PPO is pre-emptive in nature – it seeks to <em>protect</em> an applicant from family violence <em>in the future</em>. In this sense, a PPO trial is different from a prosecution where a parent is tried for having committed an offence against his/her child, e.g., under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. As a prosecution seeks to <em>punish past acts</em> of violence, details regarding the violence must be proved <em>beyond reasonable doubt</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     To sum-up, there is no need to prove the number, date(s), and manner of the past beating(s) by the Father to secure a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     For completeness, I should add that the absence of particulars regarding the number, date(s), and manner of the beating(s) in the present case does not prejudice the Father. This is because his defence is one of denial – he did not beat the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Father’s attempt to discredit the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Mr Lun submitted that I should not give any weight to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence. He contended that the child had given an “inherently contradictory” answer (“don’t know”) to his question as to whether the Father had ever taken him out to play.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> Mr Lun went on to submit that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">21    As a whole, [the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s] <em>emotional withdrawal, difficulty articulating freely, reluctance in communication, and simplistic negative characterizations</em> of his father might suggest undue psychological pressure or an implicit understanding of expected responses from his mother. The <em>lack of spontaneous elaboration and [the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s] repetitive responses</em> strengthen the suggestion that these emotional reactions could have been prompted or reinforced by [the Mother’s] influence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Testimonial evidence by witnesses with autism</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I am unable to agree with Mr Lun’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is settled law that when assessing testimonial evidence, courts give due regard to the <em>subjective characteristics</em> of the witnesses concerned. For instance, in the case of child witnesses, courts no longer assess their evidence from the perspective of rigid stereotypes – e.g., by deeming them to be less reliable and credible witnesses. Neither do courts measure their evidence through the lens of how adults would react when placed in their positions. Instead, courts assess a child’s mental development and ability to communicate on an individual basis: <em>Public Prosecutor v GCK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24365-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 1 SLR 486</a> at [97]; <em>Public Prosecutor v Yue Roger Jr</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23089-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 3 SLR 749</a> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son is a nine-year-old child with some signs of light autism. There is extensive literature regarding the behaviour of persons with autism, including as witnesses in trials. Some insights from the literature include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Persons with autism may have difficulties with verbal communication. For instance, in –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Forming complex sentences.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Understanding information what is not explicitly stated (e.g., making inferences).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Understanding non-literal or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., where a word has multiple meanings that depend on the context for interpretation).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Paying attention to oral communications when placed in a highly stressful situation. (Testifying in court can be such a situation.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Persons with autism may communicate differently. For instance, some may find it difficult to maintain eye contact. Some may also speak with an emotional tone that does not match their speech’s content (e.g., speaking neutrally about distressing events).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Persons with autism may be less able to recall details of personal experiences and contextual details (e.g., when and where did an incident occur).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Persons with autism may also report facts literally – and thus be less likely to embellish or interpret events through subjective lenses. These features can reduce the risk of exaggeration or interpretive “filling in” that is sometimes observed in neurotypical witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Trauma may cause some children with autism to exhibit behaviour such as self-injury, aggression, and emotional shutdowns – or cause such behaviour to worsen if they already exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>See e.g., the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (5<sup>th</sup> edition, American Psychiatric Association); Lucy A.

The features of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence (see [27] above in italics) are in fact <em>consistent</em> with how some persons with autism may be expected to behave: see the insights in [30] above. In the circumstances, it is wrong to conclude that the child’s evidence is neither credible nor reliable merely because he had given evidence in way that differs from neurotypical individuals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence is credible and reliable</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     Giving due regard to the subjective characteristics of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son, I find that his evidence that the Father had beaten him is more likely than not to be true. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <em>First</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not waver or show any uncertainty when he gave evidence of the beating(s) and that this was his reason for disliking the Father: see [18] and [19] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <em>Second</em>, having paid close attention to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son when he testified, I found no evidence of coaching. The child stated simply (but factually) that he was beaten by the Father without any embellishment. Further, he testified that he “did not know” how he had come to leave his paternal grandmother’s flat to stay with the Mother in September 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> He had also refused to elaborate on how he had been beaten by the Father. All these suggest that the child was not providing rehearsed detail to falsely implicate the Father. Mr Lun, who had the opportunity to test the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence, did not establish either coaching or fabrication.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35      <em>Third</em>, the unusual and spontaneous circumstances in which the beating(s) came to light are also significant. The violence was revealed after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son turned up at the Neighbour’s unit unexpectedly to seek help. Moments before this, the child had also sought his tuition teacher’s assistance to contact the Mother. He cried on seeing the Mother. All these add to the credibility of the child’s evidence that he had been beaten by the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <em>Finally</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence about the beating(s) is supported by the trauma signs that he had exhibited.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It was not disputed that after the intervention of the authorities on 17 September 2024, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had to be hospitalised for about one month: see [5] and [6] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     After his discharge from hospital, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son did not want to meet the Father when the latter visited the school. According to the child, this was because he felt scared and angry.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Additionally, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would suddenly scream and cry in the middle of the night. When questioned by the Mother about these incidents, the child replied that he had scary dreams, mostly involving the Father chasing him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Concerned by these nightmares and screaming episodes, the Mother brought the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son to a polyclinic – which then referred him to the Institute of Mental Health (“<b>IMH</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> When the Child Guidance Clinic (“<b>CGC</b>”) of IMH asked the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son about the nightmares, he drew an angry face of the Father and paternal grandmother. Disturbingly, he had also written “Papa die, grandmother die” when asked for his three wishes. Based on CGC’s clinical impression, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son was suffering from an “Emotional Disturbance of Childhood”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> (To be clear, I did not give any weight to CGC’s opinion that the Father had committed family violence and that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son would benefit from a PPO. Clearly, these are determinations to be made by a court after assessing all the evidence.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_e\"></a>(e)     At the time of the trial, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son remained deeply affected by what the Father had done to him. When asked to describe the beating(s), the child refused to elaborate – and instead chose to stand against a wall.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     To sum-up – the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s evidence (that he had been beaten) is so drastically different from that of the Father. There is no issue of the child having made a mistake. It is ultimately a question of which of the two mutually exclusive evidence is to be believed. Based on the factors in [33] to [36] above, I am satisfied that the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son had told the truth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The other incidents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I shall now turn to the other incidents relied by the Mother for her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is the Mother’s case that after the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s discharge from hospital, the Father had visited the child’s student care centre and school on the following occasions and created a scene. (The Mother was not present at either the student care centre or the school during these incidents.)</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.28%\"><col width=\"18.98%\"><col width=\"72.74%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date / Location</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Nature of incident</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">28.10.24</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Student care centre</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">The Father intimidated the staff and demanded to withdraw the two children.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">A frightened staff phoned the Mother and asked in a terrified voice, “Your husband is here persistently demanding to withdraw the children!

Her evidence regarding these incidents would have been based on hearsay accounts given by those who were present at the material times – i.e., the staff from the school and student care centre, as well as the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The Mother did not call the relevant staff to testify during the trial. This meant that there is no admissible evidence to contradict the Father’s claims that (1) he did not behave aggressively during the relevant visits, (2) he was not at the student care centre on 28 October 2024, (3) he did not speak to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son on 27 November 2024, and (4) his communications with the child on the other occasions were uneventful: see [41].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Neither did the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son provide any evidence to confirm the details in [39]. Although he did disclose in court that he had repeatedly refused to meet the Father out of fear or anger, it is unclear whether this was due to the latter’s conduct during these visits – or the prior beating(s).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, and in any event, I agree with Mr Lun that even if the hearsay evidence in [39] were to be given full weight, they would still fail to prove that “family violence” had been committed. For instance, they do not show that the Father had wilfully or knowingly placed, or attempted to place, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son in fear of hurt. Neither do they show that the Father had continually harassed the child with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause anguish to him. I accept Mr Lun’s submission that the harassment (if any) was to the staff of the student care centre / school – not the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     To sum-up, I find that the Father had beaten the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son sometime on or before 17 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, a PPO is necessary to remind the Father that he must not commit any further family violence against the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son. Such a reminder is particularly important in the present case as the child shows some signs of light autism. Research shows that children with autism often experience distressing events with heightened intensity due to sensory and emotional sensitivities. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Son’s nightmares, emotional withdrawal, and disturbing expressions are consistent with him having been deeply traumatised by the beating(s). The child ought to be protected from further family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     For the above reasons, I allowed the Mother’s PPO application – to take effect from 2 September 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For completeness, I wish to state that in March 2025, I had also granted a PPO against the Father to protect the Mother and the 1<sup>st</sup> Son: see SS 1299/2024 (“<b>SS 1299</b>”) and <em>XKJ v XKK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33042-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 35</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I stress that in deciding to grant a PPO for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Son, I was not affected by the decision in SS 1299. That decision has no bearing on the present case.

In October 2024, the Applicant applied for a personal protection order (“<b>PPO</b>”) against the Respondent. She relied on six incidents to support her application. These involved the Respondent (a) allegedly creating a scene at her business premises, (b) sending disparaging emails and messages about her to third parties, and (c) posting adverse comments and one-star reviews about her businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       To succeed, the Applicant must establish on a balance of probabilities two matters: <em>first</em>, that the Respondent had committed or is likely to commit “family violence” within the meaning of s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”). <em>Second</em>, that a PPO is necessary for her protection. The central questions in this case are thus (a) whether the Respondent’s conduct as described in [1] above amounts to family violence, and (b) whether the risk of recurrence justifies the making of a protection order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       After considering the evidence and submissions, I granted the PPO application. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 12 May 2023</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The first incident occurred on 12 May 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> That day, the Respondent had allegedly sent the Applicant messages (a) requiring her to remove her name as a co-owner of their matrimonial flat, (b) threatening to tarnish her business and personal reputation, and (c) using expletives and insulting language about her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Respondent denied having sent the messages.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The contents of the messages allegedly sent on 12 May 2023 are of critical importance in establishing whether the Respondent had committed family violence against the Applicant. Given this, she ought to have produced these messages in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Applicant had failed to do so. No explanation was provided to account for this failure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In the circumstances, I find that the Applicant had failed to prove that the Respondent had committed family violence against her on 13 May 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 3 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I now turn to the next incident. It is not disputed that (a) on 3 July 2024, the Respondent had visited the Applicant’s hair salon at Geylang (“<b>Geylang Salon</b>”) to look for her, and (b) the latter was not at the salon at the material time. The dispute regarding this incident centred on whether the Respondent had committed certain acts alleged against him during the visit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     According to “N” (the Applicant’s employee who was present during the visit), the Respondent had approached her and asked in a loud and threatening voice for the Applicant. When she replied that the Applicant was not at the salon, he started to swear and shout that the Applicant had been cheating people. Additionally, he stopped people from entering the premises – telling them that the Applicant had owed him a lot of money, cheated a lot of people, and slept with customers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> “N” reported the incident to the Applicant, who lodged a police report the next day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Respondent denied the allegations. He called “P” to support his case that his visit to the salon was uneventful. According to “P”, the Respondent left immediately upon being informed that the Applicant was not there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Applicant’s case regarding the 3 July incident rested solely on “N”’s evidence. I find that “N”’s evidence is more likely than not to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is inconceivable that “N” would – <em>on her own initiative</em> – fabricate false evidence against the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, it is also not plausible that the Applicant had instigated “N” to give false evidence for the purpose of supporting her PPO application. Based on “N”’s account, the Applicant had lodged a contemporaneous police report on 4 July 2024 (i.e., about three months before the application).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> Given that this report was made well before the application was filed – it is highly unlikely that the report was part of the Applicant’s elaborate plan to fix-up the Respondent. This is especially so when the Applicant did not mention either the 3 July incident or the police report in her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Respondent’s own evidence shows that he had a motive to confront the Applicant on 3 July 2024 – she had refused to return him $20,000 about two weeks earlier.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> “N”’s evidence that he had accused the Applicant of cheating him is thus consistent with his contemporaneous financial dispute the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Fourth</em>, “N”’s evidence – that the Respondent had maligned the Applicant’s character at the salon – is also corroborated by his messages to the Applicant’s business partner “W” sent just five days later (on 8 July 2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> In those messages, he had<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Described the Applicant as a “FAKE VIRGIN”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Accused her of having committed adultery, cheated his money, and refused to pay her creditors,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Stated his intention to warned others about the Applicant,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_d-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Admitted that he had gone to her salon to ask for money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>The close temporal proximity between the 3 July incident and the Respondent’s 8 July email strengthens the credibility of “N”’s account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e\"></a>(e)      <em>Fifth</em>, “N”’s description of the Respondent as being aggressive during the 3 July incident is consistent with how he had conducted himself during the trial. At times, he was unnecessarily difficult and combative when he cross-examined the Applicant’s witnesses and engaged with her counsel (Mr Raymund). For instance –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He had refused to answer a valid answer concerning the truthfulness of his claim that the Applicant was promiscuous.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_e-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       When it was suggested to him that he had made a threat to the Applicant in his email dated 12 July 2024 (see [16] below), the Respondent retorted <em>“... when I say, “I wish to kill you”, does that mean I will kill you?”</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f\"></a>(f)      <em>Finally</em>, I decline to give weight to “P”’s evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There is serious doubt as to how she had prepared her affidavit (exhibit R12). According to her, she prepared the affidavit in the Vietnamese language and then had it translated into English. This is contradicted by the Respondent, who testified that <em>he</em> had prepared the affidavit in <em>English</em>, and then had it translated into the Vietnamese language for “P”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Based on the Respondent’s evidence in (i) above, it appears that the contents of “P”’s affidavit were not based on her own independent recollection of the events. Indeed, “P” testified that she had obtained the relevant information from the Respondent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “P” had a salary dispute with the Applicant. Although this dispute was eventually settled, the payments were still outstanding at the time of the trial. This unresolved dispute with the Applicant potentially undermined “P”’s neutrality.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_f-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       Finally, based on “P”’s evidence, the 3 July incident would have been an uneventful one for her. After all, the Respondent did not create a scene and had left immediately upon being informed that the Applicant was not at the salon. In the circumstances, there was no reason for “P” to pay attention to the Respondent at the salon or to recall what he had said and done at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     For the reasons in [12] above, I accept “N”’s evidence. Based on this evidence, the Respondent’s conduct on 3 July 2024 – creating a scene, driving away customers, and making disparaging allegations against the Applicant – amounts to family violence. He must have known that such conduct – which appears to be intended to pressure the Applicant into paying him $20,000 – was likely to cause her fear and anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 12 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     I now come to the next incident. This concerns an email that the Respondent had sent to his case officer at a Family Services Centre (“<b>FSC</b>”) on 12 July 2024 (“<b>Email</b>”). The email (which was copied to the Applicant) alleged that the Applicant<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Was the “mother of all scammers”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Was a “very manipulative person”,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Had regularly committed adultery with a customer (a “white man”) with the ulterior motive of securing a green card,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Had adopted “disgusting, despicable, wicked and scheming” ways to fake her virginity when she met the Respondent,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Had chosen to rent an expensive apartment to stay in instead of paying $300 for a helper to care for their daughter, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Had forged the Respondent’s signature on several contracts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     According to the Respondent, he did not do anything wrong by sending the Email to his case officer. Further, he contended that the relevant information was “facts, not fabrications”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Threshold issue</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It cannot seriously be disputed that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Email would annoy the Applicant given the nature of its contents. The fact that the email had such an effect had been confirmed by the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The attacks on her character were repeated in the relatively long email are thus “continual”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent must have known that the Email was likely to cause anguish to the Applicant when he sent it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Given the above, the Respondent’s act of sending the Email can come within limb (d) of the definition of “family violence” in s 64 of Charter. For a discussion of limb (d), see <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Respondent’s contention (see [15] above) raises the following issue – Does the fact that the Email was sent to the Respondent’s <em>case officer</em> take it out of the definition of family violence? (“<b>Issue</b>”)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the answer to the Issue turns on two factors: <em>One</em>, in what context did the Respondent send the Email? <em>Two</em>, was the Email motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish? Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>In what context did the Respondent send the Email</em>. Clearly, the context of the communication is important. For instance, candid statements made in good faith during counselling or mediation should not ordinarily be construed as family violence. To hold otherwise will discourage candour during such sessions and frustrate genuine attempts at resolving personal and family issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Was the Email motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish</em>. Apart from the context, it is also relevant to consider whether the Email was motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish. The law should not allow a person – under the guise of counselling and mediation – to launch malicious attacks on a family member’s character or to cause anguish. Considerations that can shed light on whether there are ulterior motives behind a statement include the following: (i) Is the statement unsolicited, (ii) What is its tone, and (iii) Has the statement been forwarded to third parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To sum-up, the Respondent’s act of sending the Email to his case officer can come within the definition of family violence unless the Email –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Was sent in a genuine effort to resolve a personal or family issue,</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Was not motivated by malice or designed to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>Given that the facts in (a) and (b) above are especially within the Respondent’s knowledge, he has the burden of proving these facts: s 103(1) and s 108 of the Evidence Act 1893.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applying the considerations </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I find that the Respondent had failed to prove the facts in [20(a)] and [20(b)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Email was not made in the context of mediation or counselling – but was a request to change the Respondent’s case officer. The Respondent made this request because he had felt that the case officer was biased against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Email was laced with vitriol and personal attacks against the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Finally</em>, the Respondent ended the Email with the ominous statement, “<em>From now onwards, I will not hesitate to tell anyone about [the Applicant]</em>”. This reveals an intention to disseminate further disparaging remarks to other persons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In these circumstances, the Email falls squarely within limb (d) of “family violence”: continual harassment likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 15 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The next incident occurred on 15 July 2024. On that day, the Respondent had gone to the Geylang and Jalan Besar salons looking for the Applicant. She was not present as she overseas at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     “T” was working at the Geylang Salon when the Respondent (a) approached her, (b) called her the Applicant’s dog, and (c) aggressively accused the Applicant of having slept with her customers and owed him a lot of money. When he began to threaten “T”, she called for the Police. He left before they arrived at the scene. According to “T”, the incident caused her to be fearful as she was concerned that the Respondent might return to the premises and threaten her again. In fact, she was so stressed by the experience that she could not sleep.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At about 6.00 pm, the Respondent approached “N” at the Jalan Besar Salon. He pointed his finger at her and said loudly that he was looking for the Applicant. She told him that the Applicant was not at the premises. At the material time, “N” was worried for her safety as there was no one else in the salon. The Respondent later stepped outside and stopped persons from entering the salon. He left shortly thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Respondent denied the allegations by “T” and “N”. He admitted to having gone to the Jalan Besar Salon sometime in mid-July 2024 with the intention of “reminding” the Applicant about the loan. She was however not around.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Respondent called “P” – who was present in the Geylang Salon at the material time – to testify about the incident. According to her, there were no customer at the area where the Respondent was standing, and the workers were chatting with one another. Before leaving, he asked “T” whether she wanted to lodge a police report about his visit. When the latter said no, he left. The Respondent was in the salon for less than five minutes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I find the evidence of “T” and “N” to be more credible and reliable that that of the Respondent and “P”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on the Respondent’s account of the visits, they were uneventful. To accept his account, I must find that the Applicant had instigated <em>two</em> of her employees to falsely testify that he had visited <em>two</em> salons on the same day to create disturbances. I do not find this to be likely. If the Applicant had wanted to fabricate false evidence against the Respondent, it would have been far easier for her to come up with a simpler narrative – e.g., that he had created a scene at just one of the salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the following lend credibility to the evidence by “T” and “N”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       They gave consistent evidence that the Respondent (1) had entered their salons <em>at different times of the same day</em>, (2) had demanded to see the Applicant, and (3) was <em>aggressive</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       Their evidence that the Respondent was upset and had accused the Applicant of cheating is consistent with the undisputed fact that there was a financial dispute between the two of them (involving $20,000) at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       Their evidence that the Respondent had created a scene at the salons and made disparaging remarks about the Applicant is also consistent with (1) the events that had happened earlier when he visited the Geylang Salon (on 3 July 2024) and (2) the contents of his email to his case officer (on 12 July 2024): see [12(c)] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_28-p2_c\"></a>(c)     I declined to give weight to “P”’s evidence given that her neutrality had been called into question: see [12(f)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 16 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     One day after his visit to the salons, the Respondent posted a one-star review about the Applicant’s restaurant at Marina One and one of her salons.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In his review about the restaurant, he hinted that its business was not doing well and that its positive reviews could have been faked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for his review of the salon, he commented that its owner was in debt and that readers would be signing packages at their own risk.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     According to the Respondent –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had the right to express the comments in his two reviews.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     These comments were true as they were based on the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He had learnt from his friend that the Applicant had asked her to provide a positive review.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Applicant had given discounts to customers.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       She had also used their daughter’s Facebook account to generate positive reviews for her businesses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Applicant had denied the allegations in [30(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Respondent bore the burden of proving the truth of his disparaging reviews. I find that he had failed to discharge this burden.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, he did not call the alleged friend who supplied the information.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, he did not produce any evidence to show that the Applicant had used her daughter’s Facebook account to generate positive reviews for her businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, the reviews went beyond a mere commentary on the services provided by the Applicant’s business. They attacked her <em>personal</em> creditworthiness and were clearly intended to tarnish her reputation. I therefore find that the Respondent committed family violence within s 64(d).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Incident on 23 July 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I now come to the final incident. This occurred on 23 July 2024. It is common ground that the Respondent had gone to the Geylang Salon at about 9.00 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     According to the Applicant –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_a\"></a>(a)     She immediately called the Police upon seeing him at the salon. This was because of the past incidents when he had created a scene at her salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the presence of the workers and customers, the Respondent (i) pointed his finger at the Applicant, (ii) loudly claimed that he was there to collect $20,000 from her, and (iii) accused her of being a prostitute, being indebted to a lot of people, and having committed adultery while she was still married to him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_34-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Respondent had also harassed the customers as they were leaving the salon – by (i) stopping them outside the premises and (ii) telling them that she slept with customers and cheated money, and not to patronise her salon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Respondent denied the Applicant’s account of the events. According to him –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_a\"></a>(a)     There was no customer in the salon at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had merely asked the Applicant to return the $20,000 and told her that if she refused to pay, he would hire a lawyer or a debt collector.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To protect himself from false allegations by the Applicant, he had suggested to her that she make a police report. He then waited outside the salon to wait for the Police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_35-p2_d\"></a>(d)     After the Police arrived, the Respondent suggested to them to view the salon’s CCTV and to arrest him if he had committed any act of violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to “P” –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent had arrived at the salon at around 9.30 pm. As the salon was closing, there was no customer at the premises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent spoke briefly to the Applicant, suggested that the latter call for the Police, and waved at the CCTV. The Applicant then called the Police. The Respondent waited outside the salon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_c\"></a>(c)     After the Police arrived, they spoke to the Applicant and Respondent separately. The Respondent subsequently left without entering the salon again.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I preferred the Applicant’s account of the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is common ground that the Applicant had called for the Police. Her action is consistent with someone who had acted out of genuine distress and concern for her safety at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Such distress and concern are supported by the fact that the Respondent had both <em>motive</em> to cause her harm (animosity with the Applicant for refusing to return $20,000 and for allegedly deceiving him about her virginity) and <em>prior history of harassment</em> (of creating disturbances at her salons and sending disparaging emails and messages against her).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “P”’s testimony did not undermine the Applicant’s evidence. This is because “P” was not at the front of the salon and thus unable to witness the interaction between the Applicant and the Respondent at the material time. On “P”’s own evidence, she had gone to a room at the back of the salon and had <em>shut the door</em> while the Applicant and the Respondent were at the front of the salon. The room was about 10 m away from the front of premises.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Other matters</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     For completeness, I wish to address the three points raised by the Respondent in his evidence and submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">CCTV recordings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     It is not disputed that CCTV were installed at the Geylang and Jalan Besar salons. During the trial, the Applicant did not produce the CCTV recordings to support her case that the Respondent had caused a scene at her salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Respondent submitted that the Applicant ought to have produced these recordings as they could objectively prove what had transpired at the salons at the material times.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Additionally, he submitted that (a) he would not have intentionally created a scene at these premises knowing that this would be recorded by the CCTV, and (b) it was “unbelievable” that the CCTV recordings at two different premises were not retrievable.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I accept that the Applicant’s failure to produce the relevant CCTV recordings presents a potential weakness in her case regarding the incidents on 3, 15 and 23 July.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, I find that the absence of these recordings is not fatal to her case. This is because she had explained that the recordings could not be found and that they might no longer be available due to the passage of time.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> Further, I note that her case is supported by credible witness testimony (from the Applicant, “N” and “T”) and corroborated by the Respondent’s emails and messages: see [12(d)], [14], and [29] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged motive for seeking a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The second point concerns the reason for the PPO application. The Respondent contended that the Applicant had made a false PPO application to justify securing the custody, care, and control of their daughter. He believed that she had wanted such arrangements for the child to improve her chances of getting Singapore citizenship. Additionally, he believed that the Applicant had wanted a PPO to deter him from recovering $20,000 from her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am not persuaded by the Respondent’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I find them to be highly speculative, unsubstantiated by admissible evidence, and raised belatedly only in closing submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The evidence revealed that the Applicant originally did <em>not</em> intend to apply for a PPO. About two months before the application (i.e. on 15 August 2024), her solicitors had issued a cease-and-desist letter to warn the Respondent against committing further acts of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> In October 2024, he disregarded this warning by sending a disparaging email about the Applicant to her partner. The PPO application was filed only after this email. If the Respondent did not send this email, the Applicant would not have applied for the PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The PPO application is amply supported by, among others, objective evidence in the form of the Respondent’s emails and messages. These contained offensive comments about the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Alleged collusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     This conveniently brings me to the last point raised by the Respondent. He submitted that the evidence of “N” and “T” are unreliable – contending that they contained “inconsistencies”, were “orchestrated”, and were given at the bidding of the Applicant (their employer) due to their close relationship with her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     I am unable to accept the Respondent’s submissions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     I do not find any material inconsistency in “N”’s and “T”’s evidence. The inconsistencies alluded to by the Respondent do not undermine the core of their evidence – i.e., that he had caused disturbances at the salons during the relevant incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Respondent’s submission of collusion among the witnesses relates only to the 3 and 15 July incidents. (For the other incidents, the supporting evidence is based on the Respondent’s emails and messages.) For the reasons set out in [12] and [28] above, I find that it is unlikely that the Applicant, “N”, and “T” had colluded to give false evidence regarding the Respondent’s visits to the salons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">PPO is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     To re-cap – I have found that on five occasions in July 2024, the Respondent had engaged in conduct that amounted to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The question is whether a PPO is necessary. In my view, it is.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Applicant testified that she has been distressed and fearful for her safety and livelihood. This fear is well-founded given the Respondent’s repeated harassment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the Respondent had showed no remorse for his conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       He claimed that he was “telling the truth” and correcting the misinformation that the Applicant had spread about him. Such a bare claim is clearly disingenuous. He had failed to produce any evidence to support it. It is also unclear how creating a scene at the Applicant’s business premises and sending random and unsolicited emails, messages, and adverse one-star reviews can correct the alleged misinformation about him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Respondent had no qualm about making serious accusations against the Applicant without any basis. For instance, he claimed that she had committed adultery and had refused to return a $100,000-loan she took from a businessman.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> However, when asked for his evidence to support these claims, he admitted that he did not have any.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Respondent continued to publish offensive statements about the Applicant even after her solicitors had issued him a cease-and-desist letter in August 2024. On 7 October 2024, he sent a lengthy email to the Applicant’s partner in which he repeated his accusations that she was a cheat, a “FAKE VIRGIN”, and a prostitute. He had also (1) provided details of his sexual intercourse with the Applicant, (2) accused her of cheating government agencies, (3) expressed his intention to “bash up” the partner for engaging in an adulterous relationship with her, and (4) threatened to publish his story about the Applicant as he “wanted people in different industries to see her true colors”. (exhibit C2) During cross-examination, the Respondent admitted that his intention of sending the 7 October 2024 email was to shame the Applicant.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       At the time of the trial, the Respondent continued to harbour deep resentment towards the Applicant and an intent to embarrass her. For instance, he repeated his accusations that the Applicant had faked her virginity and was a cheat in his written submissions.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       As evident from above, the Respondent’s conduct was not an isolated lapse but part of an escalating pattern. They are clearly vindictive and reprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, there is a real risk of further conflict and harassment if no protective order is in place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       At the time of this decision, the issue of the $20,000 payment – which is the one of the key triggers for the family violence in this case – remains unresolved. The Respondent knew that there were the “legal” means for recovering the $20,000 from the Applicant – either through a lawyer or a licensed debt collector.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> Despite this knowledge, he turned to pressure tactics to recover the money.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_48-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The parties will also need to interact with each other to facilitate the Applicant’s access to their daughter. Based on the evidence at the trial, this is yet another potential source of conflict between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Accordingly, I order that the Respondent is not to use family violence in any form against the Applicant. The PPO shall take immediate effect. Further, I order that the Respondent is to pay costs of $4,000 to the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Before concluding, I wish to address the following message to the Respondent directly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is an offence to breach this order. If you intentionally do so, you may be arrested and punished with a fine or imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You know that lawful means exist to recover debts. Do not take the law into your own hands.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the trial, you have repeatedly justified your actions by claiming that you were simply telling the truth. The law requires that if you make allegations, you must prove them with admissible evidence. Bare assertions are insufficient and can expose you to liability for harassment, breach of PPO, or defamation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Your marriage ended more than two years ago. It is time to move on. I urge you to put aside your bitterness and focus on your daughter’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Sending vulgar emails and messages – e.g., that you visit prostitutes and that the Applicant is one – serves no purpose but to poison the environment in which your daughter is growing up. She will need both parents to provide stability in her life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_50-p2_f\"></a>(f)     Finally, your daughter is now about ten years old.

<em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [19(b)(i)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       It is for that reason that, in addition to requiring that an applicant prove on a balance of probabilities that either an act of family violence had been committed, or was likely to be committed on the person sought to be protected, the applicant must also establish that it is <b><em>necessary</em></b> to order the PPO for that person’s protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These were the following 6 applications before me:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_a\"></a>(a)     SS 520/2024. This was XQW’s application against XQV. They are siblings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_b\"></a>(b)     SS 521/2024. This was XQW’s application against XQX. XQW is XQX’s uncle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_c\"></a>(c)     SS 522/2024. This is XQY’s application against XQZ.

They are siblings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_e\"></a>(e)     SS 592/2024. This is XQX’s application against XQW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_3-p2_f\"></a>(f)     SS 593/2024. This was XQV’s application against XQW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       There were a total of 5 parties across these 6 applications. They were split into two camps.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On one side, there was XQW and XQY. On the other was XQV, XQX and XQZ. At the trial before me, XQW and XQY were acting in person. Mr Patrick Fernandez (“Mr Fernandez”) acted for XQV, XQX and XQZ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Parties had been involved in a scuffle that had taken place at Changi General Hospital on 13 March 2024. They had gone to see Mr M, who was the patriarch of the family. They ran into each other. Tempers flared. It is alleged that punches were thrown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       During trial, parties presented competing narratives of what had actually happened that day and the injuries they had suffered. Apart from this incident, there are also other complaints. For instance, XQY alleged that XQV and XQZ had shouted Tamil expletives at her previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       While much effort had been expended on whether family violence had actually been committed, the major fault line running through all six applications lay in whether it was indeed necessary to order a PPO. It is clear from the jurisprudence of our family courts that even if the court finds that family violence had been committed, a PPO may not be issued if the court finds that it is not necessary to protect the person in question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In this connection, it is well-established law that in assessing necessity, the court is undertaking a risk assessment as to the likelihood of the respondent committing family violence, in the future, on the person for whom the PPO is sought. Factors that the court will weigh in its assessment include the likelihood of interactions between the parties, whether the underlying cause for family violence has been resolved, and factors that are specific to the respondent (for instance, where the respondent is deeply antagonistic, or where the respondent has a propensity for violence): <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [20] – [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     There was, in my judgment, a low risk of parties committing family violence on each other in the future. For one, it was clear to me that parties are not living together. They also do not meet occasionally, and indeed, it was clear to me that the only reason that led to the filing of these 6 PPO applications was that parties had run into each other when they went to visit the patriarch, Mr M, in hospital.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     That they did not share a common space, and did not meet frequently was also, in my judgment, a significant factor pointing to there being a low risk of parties committing family violence on each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     While it was indeed true that parties may run into each other when go to visit Mr M, I did not consider this to be a factor pointing to an elevated risk of parties committing family violence on each other. The evidence before me did not show that parties would regularly run into each other whenever they went to visit Mr M.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     To sum up, all six applications were dismissed. None of the parties had proven, on a balance of probabilities, that it was indeed necessary for a PPO to be ordered for their protection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     As for costs, Mr Fernandez submitted that XQZ should be entitled to costs against XQY (for SS 522), and that XQV should be entitled to costs against XQY (for SS 523). That is because XQY’s application against both XQZ and XQC had been dismissed, and given that neither XQZ or XQV had filed cross-applications, XQZ and XQV should be entitled to costs as they had succeeded in defending against XQY’s application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As to the quantum of costs, Mr Fernandez submitted that it should be fixed at $4000 (all-in) for SS 522. Mr Fernandez also sought the same quantum of costs for SS 523. In relation to the other four applications, Mr Fernandez sought no order as to costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In response, XQY said that she was not in a position to pay costs. She also said it was not fair to make her pay “damages” especially considering how XQV had behaved towards her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Insofar as XQY speaks of “damages” – it must be emphasised that costs are not damages, and that no damages are awarded in the wake of a PPO trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     As a starting point, given that SS 522 and 523 were dismissed, and there were no cross-applications, XQZ and XQV would be entitled to costs. However, the reality of the litigation before me was that, as I have noted, parties were split into two camps with XQW and XQY on one side, and XQV, XQX and XQZ on the other. Given that I had dismissed all six applications, it may be said that there was no winner between the two camps. Any costs order made should be reflective of this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I therefore made no order as to costs in respect of all 6 applications.</p> </div></content></root>"}]
