The Plaintiff wife (“Wife”) is an American citizen and the Defendant husband (“Husband”) is a Singapore citizen. Interim Judgment was granted on 21 March 2024, based on the ground of 4 years’ separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       According to the agreed amended Statement of Particulars, the parties started living separately in December 2018, after only 9 (nine) months of marriage. However, the parties purchased their matrimonial home in the US sometime in September 2019, <em>after</em> they started living separately. The Wife left the matrimonial home sometime in June 2023 and subsequently moved to Japan, where she is currently residing. The Husband is still residing in the US.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Parties had signed a pre-nuptial agreement in the US on 7 March 2018 (“the pre-nup agreement”) in contemplation of marriage, in which they agreed that the assets now owned or later acquired by either party would remain their own separate property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> - in other words, such assets would not be subject to division. The pre-nup agreement also stated that in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, neither party would seek “<em>any form of alimony or support</em>” from the other party. It is noted that both parties had the benefit of their own legal counsel in the US and both counsel had also signed and witnessed the pre-nup agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 3 April 2018, 2 weeks after the parties were married, they signed another agreement to supplement the terms in the pre-nup agreement (“the supplemental agreement”). The supplemental agreement provided that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> (i) in the event the Wife’s parents found out about the marriage and stopped paying for her college tuition, the Defendant husband (“Defendant”) would “<em>provide financial support to cover”</em> the Wife’s “<em>college tuition and reasonable rent</em>” for the remainder of her college studies; and (ii) the Wife shall provide the Husband “<em>the billing statement from the college she attends at the beginning of each semester</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Initially the Wife sought a just and equitable division of all the parties’ assets, and not just their matrimonial home. In the Wife’s submissions filed on 30 April 2025, she included all the assets in parties’ respective names in the matrimonial pool. At the first hearing on 28 May 2025, I directed the parties to file supplemental affidavits on the date of acquisition of parties’ respective assets and further submissions on <em>inter alia</em>, the date of determination of the asset pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the subsequent hearing on 4 July 2025 before me, the Wife’s counsel clarified that the Wife was no longer seeking division of all matrimonial assets, but only division of the parties’ matrimonial home. Both parties agreed that they would retain other assets in their respective names and there would be no division of the same. In the circumstances, there is no need for me to examine the date of determination of the pool of matrimonial assets. The only disputed ancillary matters are (i) the division of the matrimonial home; (ii) maintenance for the Wife; and (iii) payment of certain sums claimed by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       These are my orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i\"></a>(i)     The matrimonial home at xx Wilshire Blvd #xx, Los Angeles, California, USA is to be sold in the open market within one year of the date of Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be applied as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_a\"></a>(a)       To make full payment of the outstanding mortgage loan;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_b\"></a>(b)       To pay all costs and expenses incidental and relating to the sale of the property; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i-p3_c\"></a>(c)       The balance sale proceeds to be divided 34.1% to the Plaintiff and 65.9% to the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_ii\"></a>(ii)     Each party shall retain all other assets in their respective names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_iii\"></a>(iii)     There shall be no maintenance for the Plaintiff with no liberty to apply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The following are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Legal effect of foreign pre-nuptial agreements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       As the Wife is no longer seeking division of parties’ assets other than the matrimonial home, there is no need for me to go into the terms of the parties’ pre-nup agreement regarding the division of matrimonial assets. However, as I will explain below, the Wife is choosing to rely on the terms of the supplemental agreement signed after the pre-nup agreement in her claim for maintenance or, more specifically, payment by the Husband for the Wife’s college tuition fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Both parties signed the pre-nup agreement in the US and it is for all intents and purposes a pre-nuptial agreement governed by US law. Assuming the pre-nup agreement is valid and enforceable in the US, what is its applicability in the Singapore divorce proceedings where parties have submitted to jurisdiction in Singapore and seek to have their ancillary matters decided in Singapore?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     In <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> [2009] 2 SLR (R) 961, the court found that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> where a provision of the relevant statute expressly covers a certain category of prenuptial agreement, then that provision would be the governing law. However, if the statute is silent, then the legal status of the relevant prenuptial agreement will be governed by the common law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Where Singapore law is the governing law with respect to ancillary matters and there is a valid pre-nuptial agreement regarding the division of matrimonial assets which is governed by foreign law, the courts may consider<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>, as part of all the circumstances of the case, the pre-nuptial agreement in arriving at a just and equitable division of the matrimonial assets. The weight given to such a pre-nuptial agreement would depend on the precise facts and circumstances of the case. However, such an agreement cannot be enforced in and of itself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Where the pre-nuptial agreement relates to spousal maintenance, in the absence of any applicable statutory provision, the common law principles would apply and the court would ascertain whether the terms of such agreement are just and fair.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Direct contributions to the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Parties’ matrimonial home is an apartment in California, US, which the parties purchased as joint tenants in September 2019, ostensibly <em>after</em> the parties had already started living separately. The Husband valued the property at USD565,231 while the Wife’s estimated valuation was USD582,960. The Husband’s valuation was based on an average of the estimated value of a similar property on 3 different real estate websites, realtor.com, redfin and Zillow. The Wife did not provide any documents in support of her estimated valuation, thus I accept the Husband’s estimated valuation. It is not disputed that the outstanding mortgage loan as at 10 June 2024 was USD341,551.51.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Both parties agreed that the matrimonial home should be sold within one year. The dispute is over the percentage of division of the matrimonial home. Each party claims that they are entitled to 69% of the sale proceeds of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Downpayment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     It is not disputed that the payment of USD147,859.08 towards the downpayment for the matrimonial home was paid from the Wife’s bank account sometime in September 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. The main dispute is over each party’s contribution towards this payment. The Husband claimed that he paid USD97,000 towards the downpayment while the Wife paid only USD63,609.08<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. The Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> she paid USD74,609.08 towards the downpayment, and that the Husband only contributed USD89,000 towards the downpayment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Husband’s case was that his contribution of USD97,000 was made up of the following: (i) an undisputed loan of USD80,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> from his father; (ii) “reimbursements” of USD12,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> in total, paid to the Wife in 7 separate bank transfers from September to November 2019; and (iii) a cheque of USD5,000 to the Wife dated 5 October 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. The Wife claimed however that two of the “reimbursements” made in September 2019, totalling USD4,000, were for home renovation and not for the downpayment as they were labelled as such. The Husband’s explanation was that he had done so<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> because parties had been advised by their mortgage brokers that banks did not like seeing funds for downpayment accumulated from too many different sources.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Wife’s calculations that she paid $74,609.08 for the downpayment were based on a table<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that she compiled by simply deducting the Husband’s payments to her from the total downpayment sum. She did not provide any supporting documentation of her payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As the Husband’s payments of USD97,000 were all supported by documentary evidence, I accepted the Husband’s version that he paid this sum towards the downpayment. At the time the Husband transferred the disputed monies to the Wife in September 2019, the mortgage loan had just been disbursed and parties had not undertaken any renovations, as such I accepted that the full payment of USD97,000 made by the Husband went towards the downpayment of the property. It is irrelevant whether the disputed sum of USD4,000 was paid towards renovations or the downpayment, because in either case, the sum would still count towards the Husband’s direct contributions to the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The exact downpayment figure paid by both parties varied between USD155,000 and USD163,609.08. The sum of USD155,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> appeared to be based on what parties had initially budgeted for when they planned the purchase of the matrimonial home. In any event, the Husband accepted that the Wife’s direct contribution towards the downpayment was at least USD63,609.08 so I accepted this figure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mortgage loan repayments</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Both parties accepted that the total mortgage loan repayments amounted to USD100,835.35<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. The dispute was over how much each party contributed towards this sum. The Wife at first claimed that she had paid $20,248.68<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> towards the mortgage loan repayments, but then changed this figure to $30,822.11<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. The Husband submitted that he had made 100% of the mortgage loan repayments, in accordance with parties’ agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> that he would do so while the Wife would pay for the Homeowners Association fees, property tax and insurance for the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     It is not disputed that the mortgage loan was paid out of parties’ joint Bank of America account number 3251-0993-xxxx (“the Joint Account”), and both parties had deposited monies into the Joint Account. The Wife claimed that she transferred monies from her personal account to the Joint Account, but did not provide a clear explanation of how she arrived at either the sum of $20,24.68 or $30,822.11 for her share of the mortgage payments. Instead, she provided only a tabulation of transfers<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> she claimed to have made from her personal account to the Joint Account, totalling USD104,619 over a period of a few years. At the hearing on 4 July 2025, the Wife’s counsel then submitted that half of the sum of USD30,000 paid towards the mortgage from the Joint Account, being USD15,000, should be attributed to the Wife’s direct contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> the Wife’s transfers to the Joint Account were payments for her vehicle loan, vehicle insurance, as well as payments for her other expenses, including the Homeowners Association fees, all of which were paid from the Joint Account as well. After deducting these payments, there was “little to no excess”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> for the mortgage payments from her. The Husband pointed out that in 2020<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>, the Wife transferred a total of USD12,090 to the Joint Account and out of this amount, USD10,302.16 went towards payment of the Wife’s vehicle loan, USD404.16 to payment of her vehicle insurance, USD2,022.64 towards 3 payments to the Homeowners Association, and USD600 was transferred back to the Wife’s personal account. In short, the Wife withdrew more funds for her personal payments than what she had transferred to the Joint Account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     While the Wife claimed she had made a total of USD104,619 in transfers to the Joint Account, this was from the period of June 2018 to August 2021 and the mortgage loan was only disbursed in September 2019. The Husband had calculated that from September 2019 onwards, the Wife’s transfers to the Joint Account totalled only USD63,045<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. I was satisfied that the Wife’s total withdrawals for her vehicle-related payments, Homeowners Association payments and other personal expenses also exceeded her deposits for the year 2020.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     However, I note that in 2021, the Wife started transferring larger sums of money to the Joint Account, and her total deposits in 2021 alone amounted to USD49,300. The Wife’s withdrawals from the Joint Account that year totalled USD45,308.26<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>, leaving a balance of USD3,991.74 which could have been applied towards the mortgage payments. In the circumstances, I accepted the sum of USD3,991.74 to be the Wife’s direct contribution towards the mortgage payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Renovations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Wife claimed that she had paid USD42,026.86<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> towards home renovations whereas the Husband’s case was that she had only spent USD18,599.87<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> for renovations and furniture. In May 2020, there were repairs and renovations done to the matrimonial home due to flood damage. Unfortunately, the Wife did not explain or itemise the renovations she had personally paid for, and provided only a tabulation of payments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> she had allegedly made towards renovation costs for the period September 2019 to August 2020. The Wife also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> she had purchased USD38,858.51 worth of household appliances, furnishings and decorations, which should be attributed towards her <em>indirect</em> contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband submitted that most of the repairs and renovations due to the flood damage was paid for by parties’ home insurance. The charges from the Homeowners Association for mitigation of damages and reconstruction of damaged portions were paid for by insurance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. Parties also received cheques from their insurance company totalling USD10,419.46<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>, which were deposited into the Wife’s account, which was used to partially offset the cost of USD16,800 for the renovation of the bathroom. As for the remainder of the bathroom renovations not paid for by insurance, amounting to about USD6,380.54, I attributed this to each party equally. The Husband also accepted that the Wife had paid USD1,829.26 and USD1,457 towards the renovation and cabinets, thus I added these sums to her contribution towards the renovations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In my view, the Wife’s tabulation of payments supposedly made for renovations consisted of what looked like purchases from (or payments to) household or furniture stores such as The Home Depot, Crate and Barrel and Ikea; and included items like door lock, wall outlets and strip lights. This accorded with the Wife’s claim that she had actually purchased most of the household appliances, furnishings and decorations, which would count towards her indirect financial contributions towards the property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Does payment of home insurance or property tax count towards direct or indirect financial contributions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Husband included the payments towards the Homeowners Association fees, home insurance and property tax as part of the parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span>. The Wife did not include such payments as part of parties’ direct contributions but as part of their indirect financial contributions<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Much ink was spilled on parties’ dispute over how much each had paid towards the Homeowners Association fees and property tax for the matrimonial home. The Wife claimed that she paid a total of USD42,501.84<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> towards the Homeowners Association fees, while the Husband claimed she only paid USD41,195.04 towards the same as the Wife’s deposits into the Joint Account for August to October 2020 were insufficient to pay for the same<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span>. The Wife submitted that she had paid USD9,464.72 towards property tax for the property and the Husband submitted he had paid USD29,311.75 towards the same<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span>. However, the Wife claimed that the Husband’s payments for property tax in February 2020, November 2020 and February 2021 should not be counted as his contributions because he had also paid his credit card bills from the Joint Account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     It is trite law that the direct financial contributions towards a matrimonial property include monies applied towards the acquisition of the property as well as monies which go toward the “<em>improvement</em>” of the property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span>. Payments for household outgoings, such as payments for home insurance, management fees and property tax are more appropriately considered expenses which are necessary for the maintenance of the matrimonial property, instead of expenses for the acquisition or improvement of the property. As such, I did not include the payments of the Homeowners Association fees, home insurance and property tax in the calculation of parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial home.

The Husband submitted that the marriage was so short that any indirect contributions should be disregarded<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>, effectively, that <em>only</em> parties’ direct contributions should be taken into account in the division of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The law on division of matrimonial assets in short and childless marriages is traditionally that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> division would be in accordance with parties’ direct financial contributions only, as non-financial contributions would usually be “<em>minimal</em>” in such cases. In <em>WGW v. WGX</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29293-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 5</a>, the marriage was a short and childless one of about three and a half years. The court found that the parties there “<em>did not go through with the customary traditions of marriage</em>”, it was disputed at length whether the parties had even lived together, and thus the court gave “<em>no weight</em>” to indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In <em>WUI v. WUJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31716-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 25</a>, however, the High Court highlighted the risk<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> of using labels of “short”, “moderate” or “long” to categorise marriages and allowing such labels to take precedence over assessing the actual facts of the case. While it was pointed out that this did not change the legal position that “<em>indirect contributions would in many cases be minimal, if not irrelevant, when it comes to “short marriages”</em>”, the court’s view was that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> it was only in clear-cut cases where the marriage “<em>was effectively of a de minimis duration</em>”, that <em>zero</em> weight should be ascribed to the parties’ indirect contributions. It was also clarified that where a marriage is so short that indirect contributions are “<em>of little to no importance</em>”, these are usually cases where the <em>effective</em> length of the marriage is less than three years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     It cannot be gainsaid that while it is essential to look to case precedents when applying established legal principles, the facts of each particular case are always different and it is particularly important in matrimonial proceedings not to simply apply a “one-size-fits-all” approach. The facts of the present case are rather unique. Even though parties acknowledged that the period of cohabitation was very short, and they started living separately after only nine months of marriage, they nevertheless went on to purchase the matrimonial home together in September 2019, <b>almost a year after</b> their separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     It is not disputed that parties then proceeded to continue with their financial obligations towards the matrimonial home, both depositing monies into, and having the household outgoings paid through, the Joint Account until sometime in October 2022. The Husband conceded that the marriage had definitely broken down by around October 2022<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span>, when he sent the Wife a text message to discuss divorce. It is also not disputed that after the purchase of the matrimonial home, the parties did work together with regard to the renovations and repairs of the matrimonial home after the flood in 2020, and each took care of various payments for the household outgoings. The Wife also concedes that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> her claim for indirect contribution mainly consists of indirect <em>financial</em> contribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In <em>TYY v. TYZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20095-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCF 6</a>, the High Court had taken into account parties’ indirect contributions in the division of assets, even after the parties started staying in separate bedrooms under one roof. While the marriage in <em>TYY v. TYZ</em> was a much longer one than in the present case, the court found that the marriage still existed “<em>in a meaningful sense</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span> despite parties’ separation, as the actions of parties in relation to the assets where they worked together to make renovations to the matrimonial home, rent out the created rooms and used the rental monies for the benefit of their children, was during the subsistence of the marriage. As such, the court found that such indirect contributions could be taken into account in the division of assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The ultimate overarching objective of the division of matrimonial assets is to ensure that each party’s contribution towards the marriage, both direct and indirect, is duly recognised such that the outcome leads to a just and equitable division<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. Based on the particular facts of this case, I find that notwithstanding that parties lived separately after only 9 months of marriage, they both contributed indirectly in terms of the outgoing expenses of the matrimonial home and also worked together on the renovations and repairs to <em>improve</em> the matrimonial home. In the circumstances, I would attribute the indirect contributions equally between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Accordingly, the overall ratio would be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.92%\"><col width=\"32.2%\"><col width=\"33.88%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Direct</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">27.3%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">72.7%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Indirect</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">50%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">50%</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Division ratio (with rounding)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">39%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">61%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Adjustment of final ratio of division and “uplift”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife had argued that the weightage should be 70:30<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span> in favour of direct contributions, due to the short marriage. She also submitted that the Husband had undisclosed assets, had enjoyed “sole occupation of the matrimonial home”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span> since June 2023, and an uplift of 6% should therefore be applied to increase the final ratio of division in her favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     In <em>USB v. USA and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24645-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 57</a>, the Court of Appeal affirmed the application of the <em>ANJ v. ANK</em> structured approach to short marriages. The court also stated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> one of the key characteristics of the structured approach was that it gave the discretion to set the weightage in terms of the relative importance of the direct and indirect contributions. This was “<em>especially useful</em>” in short marriages. It was also reiterated that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> while the court may have a discretion to adjust the weightage of direct and indirect contributions in a short marriage, the court is not compelled to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The ultimate goal of the court, in an exercise of determining the final division ratio for matrimonial assets, is to achieve a <em>just and equitable</em> division between parties under s112(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“the Charter”). As stated above, this was an unusually short marriage and the parties had only cohabited for about nine months before living separately. Even by the Wife’s own submission, the “<em>actual duration of marriage was only 2 years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span></em>”. There were no children to the marriage and parties largely kept their lives and finances separate, apart from the outgoings for the matrimonial home. In the circumstances, I found that the direct contributions should be given greater weight and that a weightage of 70:30 in favour of direct contributions was appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     I did not however agree with the Wife’s submission that she should be given any “uplift” as the other matrimonial assets were no longer in dispute, each party had agreed to retain their respective assets in their names and any “non-disclosure” of assets was irrelevant. Given the above, the final division ratio between the parties is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>Wife</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[(27.3/100) x 70] + [(50/100) x 30] = 19.11 + 15 = <b>34.1</b> (rounded up)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <b><u>Husband</u></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a>[(72.7/100) x 70] + [(50/100) x 30] = 50.89 + 15 = <b>65.9</b> (rounded up)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance and sums claimed by the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The Wife sought an order for the Husband to pay her monthly maintenance of USD1,500. In addition to this, the Wife also wanted the Husband to pay her (i) the sum of USD88,741.30, being her tuition/university fees incurred; and (ii) the sum of USD40,903.15 being her legal fees. The Wife claimed that this was based on the Husband’s agreement to pay for her tuition/university fees if the Wife’s parents disowned her upon finding out about the marriage, and the Husband’s promise to pay for her legal fees in the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Spousal maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     It is trite law that the overarching principle for awarding an ex-wife maintenance is “<em>financial preservation, which requires the wife to be maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent, commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed during the marriage</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_52\" id=\"Ftn_52_1\"><sup>[note: 52]</sup></a></span>. This must however be applied in a manner that takes into account the “<em>new realities</em>”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_53\" id=\"Ftn_53_1\"><sup>[note: 53]</sup></a></span> flowing from the breakdown of a marriage. It is also clear that the ex-wife is not entitled to expect a full subsidy for her lifestyle and must <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_54\" id=\"Ftn_54_1\"><sup>[note: 54]</sup></a></span>“<em>exert reasonable efforts to secure gainful employment and to sustain her pre-breakdown lifestyle</em>”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Nominal maintenance for an ex-wife is also not awarded “automatically” or as a matter of course; and when assessing the appropriate quantum of spousal maintenance to be ordered<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_55\" id=\"Ftn_55_1\"><sup>[note: 55]</sup></a></span>, the courts will take into account the share of matrimonial assets awarded to the ex-wife. The relevant factors to be taken into account, when awarding maintenance for an ex-wife, are listed in s114 of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     As stated above, the parties’ pre-nup agreement also stated that in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, neither party would seek “<em>any form of alimony or support</em>” from the other party. The relevant clauses are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<b><em>8. SUPPORT</em></b></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Each of the parties has income from individual property interests sufficient to provide for his or her respective support… Therefore, in the event of a marital separation or dissolution, it is agreed and understood that neither party shall seek or obtain any form of alimony or support from the other.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>10. MUTUAL WAIVER OF RIGHT TO RECEIVE SPOUSAL SUPPORT.</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>…</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Accordingly, should either party file an action for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, or should there be a judgment for dissolution of marriage or legal separation between the parties by a court of competent jurisdiction, [Wife’s name] waives and shall be forever barred from asserting a claim for spousal support, regardless of the circumstances then existing, including pendente lite spousal support, against [Husband’s name]. The parties knowingly, willingly, and voluntarily waive their rights to spousal support. No court shall have jurisdiction to order spousal support to either party under any circumstances.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Given the express terms of the pre-nup agreement, I found it extremely surprising that the Wife maintained her claim for spousal maintenance in the proceedings. While the Charter appears to be silent on prenuptial agreements relating to maintenance, the court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> took the view that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_56\" id=\"Ftn_56_1\"><sup>[note: 56]</sup></a></span> all prenuptial agreements relating to the maintenance of the wife would also be subject to the overall scrutiny of the court and if the terms of such an agreement were just and fair, the court could endorse such terms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Even without the pre-nup agreement, it was not disputed that the parties kept their finances separate during the short marriage or that the Husband did not support the Wife financially during the marriage. By the Wife’s own admission, after she claimed that her parents stopped supporting her during the marriage, she paid for her own expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_57\" id=\"Ftn_57_1\"><sup>[note: 57]</sup></a></span> using her credit facilities, savings, stock investments and reselling her luxury bags.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span> since she graduated from university in 2020, she was not able to find any work and currently relies on her stock investments and savings to pay for her monthly expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>, which come up to USD3,162.75. The Wife is very young, only 29 years old, and has a university degree. While she claimed that she is now trying to find a job in marketing, she has not provided any evidence of her efforts to find employment. The Wife herself has conceded that she has been able to support herself financially even without employment, and she has an earning capacity. Based on all the circumstances of the case and the extremely short marriage, I find it appropriate to order no maintenance for the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Claim for the Husband to pay for the Wife’s university fees </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span> her parents had found out about parties’ marriage around 2018 and had disowned her. She also claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> she then borrowed USD250,000 from her aunt and used the money to pay for her university fees. The Wife relied on the supplemental agreement to support her claim that the Husband should pay her for the university fees incurred by her. The relevant clause in the supplemental agreement is as follows<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>In the event that Ms T’s parents found out about her marriage to Mr H, and stopped paying for her college tuition, Mr H hereby warrants that he will provide financial support to cover Ms T’s college tuition and reasonable rent for the remaining of Ms T’s college studies. Ms T shall provide Mr H the billing statement from the college she attends at the beginning of each semester.</em>”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The Husband submitted that the Wife had not met any of the conditions in the supplemental agreement in order to claim that he should reimburse her for her university fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I have briefly dealt with the legal effect of foreign pre-nuptial agreements regarding the division of matrimonial assets in Singapore above. The supplemental agreement was technically not a pre-nuptial agreement as it was signed by parties shortly after marriage, and the Wife herself agrees that this should be regarded as a <em>postnuptial</em> agreement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Sections 116 and 119 of the Charter deal with agreements for maintenance. As stated by the court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span></em>, all postnuptial agreements with respect to maintenance are subject to the scrutiny of the court and the courts have the <em>statutory</em> power to override or vary any postnuptial agreement with respect to maintenance if the circumstances so warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     While the Wife sought to rely on the supplemental agreement as a postnuptial agreement dealing with maintenance, it was not in my view such an agreement. The court in <em>TQ v. TR and another appeal</em> highlighted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span> there were two kinds of postnuptial settlements, separation and pre-divorce settlements where parties decided on what happens upon their separation or divorce, as the case may be. The relevant clause in the settlement agreement, however, seemed to be phrased to cover an event occurring <em>for the duration of the Wife’s university studies</em>, and not upon the parties’ divorce or separation. The preamble of the supplemental agreement provides that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“<em>WHEREAS, Ms T is a sophomore in college, and her parents are paying for her college tuition; Ms T is afraid that her parents might stop paying for her college tuition if they found out about the marriage;</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>WHEREAS, Ms T desires to have and Mr H is willing to provide financial support </em> <b><em>during the course of Ms T’s college studies</em></b> <em>;” [emphasis added by me]</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The above preamble and words of the relevant clause: “<em>In the event that Ms T’s parents…stopped paying for her college tuition, Mr H ..will provide financial support to cover Ms T’s college tuition and reasonable rent </em><b><em>for the remaining of Ms T’s college studies”</em></b> and “<em>Ms T </em><b><em>shall provide</em></b><em>… the billing statement from the college she attends </em><b><em>at the beginning of each semester</em></b>” all suggested that the Husband’s obligation to provide the finances to cover the Wife’s university fees would be in the course of the Wife’s university studies. Indeed, if the Wife’s parents had stopped paying for her university studies and the Husband had not fulfilled his obligation, the Wife would not have been able to complete her studies and upon divorce, some three or four years later, this would not be a relevant point of contention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     There was no contemporaneous evidence to show that the Wife’s parents had found out about the parties’ marriage while she was still enrolled in university and had “disowned” her or cut her off financially. The Wife exhibited an email to her aunt<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>, dated 16 April 2023/2024, “acknowledging” the aunt’s financial assistance for her “educational and living expenses”. After the Husband adduced evidence of messages from 2019 to 2023 showing that he and the Wife had a cordial relationship with her mother and family members, the Wife then acknowledged that she and the Husband had regular communications with her mother and family members after the marriage. However, the Wife claimed that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span> such interactions were merely those of “courtesy and respect” and did not indicate that she received any financial support from her parents. More importantly, the Wife did not dispute that she had gone to visit her family in 2019<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>, after parties’ marriage. Neither the Wife’s aunt nor her parents filed any affidavit in support of her claims.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In any event, even if the settlement agreement was meant to apply to events post-divorce, I am of the view that the Wife has not managed to make out the condition precedents required for the Husband’s obligation to take effect. In order for the Husband to be required to pay for the Wife’s university fees, the Wife has to first prove that her parents found out about her marriage <em>and</em> stopped paying for her university fees. As stated above, the Wife has not managed to prove this. On the contrary, the evidence suggested that the Wife’s mother did not object to the parties’ marriage and was close enough to the Husband to text him directly to ask him to join them for dinner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>. Further, it is not in dispute that the Wife did not provide the Husband with her university billing statement <em>at the beginning of each semester</em>, and that she only furnished her university invoices in the course of these divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     As such, I dismiss the Wife’s claim for the Husband to reimburse her the sum of USD88,741.30 for her tuition/university fees.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Was there an agreement for the Husband to pay for the Wife’s legal fees in these proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     The Wife also submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> prior to commencing divorce proceedings, the Husband had promised to pay for her legal fees and she sought an order for him to pay the sum of USD40,903.15. While the Husband did not deny this, he responded that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span> he had agreed to pay the legal fees only if the divorce was uncontested. The Husband also submitted that this offer was made at a time when parties were attempting to reach an amicable resolution on the divorce and ancillary matters. The only evidence of such an agreement by the Husband is a text message dated 26 August stating<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span> “<em>Oh yes, include the lawyer fee in the category. My bad for missing it out.</em>” While there was no date affixed to the message, it is not disputed that the message was sent prior to the commencement of divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Based on the above, I do not find that there was a binding agreement by the Husband to pay for the Wife’s legal fees in these divorce proceedings. Parties should be free to negotiate and state their position when attempting amicable resolution and this should be encouraged. If, in the course of negotiations before proceedings are filed, parties are bound to their proposals notwithstanding that negotiations subsequently fail and proceedings become contested, there would be no meaningful attempts at resolution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In any event, the award of costs lies in the discretion of the court. Parties may file their submissions on costs within 14 days of this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Finally, it is my view that the Wife has taken an extremely unreasonable position in the ancillary matters. This was undoubtedly a short marriage with no children, and parties had also signed a pre-nuptial agreement prior to the marriage. Yet despite having the benefit of legal advice, the Wife chose to renege on the terms of the pre-nuptial agreement and insisted on her claims that parties’ assets be subject to division and that the Husband reimburse her for her university fees and pay her monthly wife maintenance. As a result, parties filed no less than 3 ancillary affidavits each and went through one Summons application for discovery, only for the Wife to abandon her claim for division of parties’ other assets at the final hearing. This could all have been avoided if the Wife had taken a reasonable position at the outset.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Tab O of the Husband’s Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 27 June 2025 (“Husband’s AOM”).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Page 381 of the Husband’s AOM.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>[50] of <em>TQ v.

The CA said that the objective of section 69 applications was to provide the Wife with a reasonable quantum of maintenance to help her overcome her immediate financial needs having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the factors listed in s.69(4), which also takes into account the earning capacity of the Parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The “immediate financial needs” approach was adopted because section 69 applications are not final maintenance applications as this comes after the divorce case, if a divorce is applied for, is finalised. In the present case, the Court noted that on paper, this marriage lasted about 34 years before the Complainant filed a Writ of Divorce in <b>D 846/2024</b> on 26 February 2024. Even if the Respondent’s case that the Parties had lived separate lives since 2008 was the date used, <b>this marriage lasted at least 18 years</b> (from the date of marriage on 24 December 1990 to 2008).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5        <b>The 3 key issues</b>: Therefore, in the Court’s view, for an IM application under s69 of the Women’s Charter, there were 3 key issues to be decided: (i) what was the Complainant’s reasonable monthly maintenance as a monetary sum (ii) whether there was neglect or refusal by the Respondent to provide such reasonable maintenance and (iii) the financial capacity of the Respondent to pay such reasonable monthly maintenance. In this regard, the Court was guided by 2 further cases for the Complainant’s IM application in <b>MSS 422 of 2024</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       These were the cases of <b><em>VXM v VXN <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26761-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 37</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong held that [at paragraph 13] “I would add that at this interim stage, the Court does not have the full means to make a thorough investigation of the Parties’ financial matters or their lifestyles, which it will have to examine thoroughly at the AM stage.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The second was the case of <b><em>WBU v WBT <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29255-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 3</a></em></b> whereby the Honourable Justice Debbie Ong also noted [at paragraph 10] that it was observed in the case of <b><em>UEB v UEC <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21448-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 5</a></em></b> at paragraph 13, that one should not be overly mesmerised by the approach of reaching a maintenance sum only by totalling up every item of expense as if it were a legal requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Hence, the Court dealt with both Parties’ positions on the <b>estimated expenses</b> of the Complainant based on her request for $8,000 per month as IM.

Therefore, it was the Respondent’s statutory duty to pay her reasonable monthly maintenance until the divorce case was completed. The Court noted that it was not disputed that the Respondent did not pay the Complainant anything after she left the company. <b>Hence, the Court was of the view that there was neglect or refusal by the Respondent to provide reasonable maintenance to the Complainant after January 2024.</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10      <b>On the final issue of the financial capacity of the Respondent to pay reasonable monthly maintenance</b>. The Court noted that the Respondent’s Counsel submitted that the Respondent’s current income was around $9,000 per month but averaged out to be at $6,823.64 with the Complainant’s average income for the past 4 years at $7,112.50 which was more than the Respondent’s. However, this did not take into account the fact that the Respondent’s total monthly expenses were given by the Respondent himself in his AOM at $22,000 per month, which begs the question of how he could afford this on his average salary of $6,800 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     It also did not take into account the fact that while the Respondent was currently earning an income, the Complainant was now unemployed at 55 years old. However, the Court was also guided by the case of <b><em>WGJ v WGI <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29413-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 11</a></em></b> wherein the Honourable Justice Choo Han Teck reasoned [in paragraph 34 of the case] that the Husband’s unemployment was by choice and that the Husband’s failed attempts at seeking employment did not mean that he had a reduced earning capacity. Hence, for the present case, the Complainant’s earning capacity was still relevant in determining her own share for her maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     On a balance of all these factors, the Court was of the view that the Complainant’s request for interim monthly maintenance payable in the sum of $8,000 for herself was not warranted. However, the Court was of the view that the Respondent should pay the sum of $2,000 to the Complainant as interim monthly maintenance until the determination of the divorce case. This should be backdated to 1st February 2024 due to the Respondent’s refusal/neglect to pay the Complainant any maintenance after she left the company and lost her salary, which was her only source of income. Therefore, the final sum owing as of today’s date was $34,000 (being 17 months from 1st February 2024 to 1st June 2025 inclusive) and thereafter at $2,000 per month until the determination of the divorce case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Accordingly, <b>MO 256/2025</b> was issued dated 3 June 2025.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Child","Family Law – Matrimonial Assets – Division","Evidence – Adverse Inference"],"date":"2025-08-12","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 34 of 2024","title":"XQF v XQG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 83","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33677-SSP.xml","counsel":["Yap Teong Liang with VM Vidthiya and Russell Huang Liang Jun for the Wife (T L Yap Chambers LLC)","Low Jin Liang with Chloe Chua Kay for the Husband (PKWA Law Practice LLC)."],"timestamp":"2025-08-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid","html":"<root><head><title>XQF v XQG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQF <em>v</em> XQG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33677-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 83</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 34 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">12 August 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Yap Teong Liang with VM Vidthiya and Russell Huang Liang Jun for the Wife (T L Yap Chambers LLC); Low Jin Liang with Chloe Chua Kay for the Husband (PKWA Law Practice LLC). </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XQF — XQG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Matrimonial Assets</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Division</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Evidence</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Adverse Inference</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">12 August 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Muhammad Hidhir Bin Abdul Majid:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This is an appeal against the ancillary orders made upon divorce between the Plaintiff (“Wife”) and the Defendant (“Husband”).

On 3 January 2024, the Wife commenced divorce proceedings on account of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. On 5 January 2024, the Husband filed a counterclaim on account of the Wife’s unreasonable behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Interim Judgment was granted on the claim and counterclaim on 20 May 2024 after a period of 4 years and 7 months of marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits and Submissions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 August 2024 (“PAOM1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 January 2025 (“PAOM2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 March 2025 (“PAOM3”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Husband filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 7 August 2024 (“DAOM1”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 January 2025 (“DAOM2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit of Assets and Means filed on 3 March 2025 (“DAOM3”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Wife and Husband submitted their respective written submissions on 30 April 2025. The ancillary matters were heard on 7 and 15 May after which clarifications were sought on certain issues before the decisions were made on 24 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Child’s maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The power of the court to order maintenance for children is found in section 127 of the Women’s Charter 1961. Section 127(2) provides that the provisions of Parts 8 and 9 apply to such applications with the necessary modification. Section 68 provides that a parent has the duty to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or her children by providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education as may be reasonable having regards to his or her means and station in life or by paying the cost thereof. Under section 69(4), the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters set out in the subsection.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ Income</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife did not seek any maintenance for herself and only sought reasonable maintenance for the child who was about 2 years old at the time of the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Wife was a business development manager earning an average salary of $13,266 and a monthly net salary of $10,387. The Husband was a legal affairs manager earning an average salary of $14,490 and a monthly net salary of $10,732.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband submitted that his monthly expenses amounted to $12,584.42 which exceeded his net salary. The Wife argued that his monthly expenses were inflated to project an impression that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain the child. She extracted his breakdown of expenses and set out her replies against each item to show the expenses were either exaggerated, speculative and devoid of evidence or supporting documents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span>. His monthly expenses included anticipated expenses post-divorce for mortgage which was stated as $4,000 and utility bill of $100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife submitted that her personal expenses amounted to $6,649.40.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Having considered the evidence and submissions, I agreed with the Wife that the Husband’s monthly expenses were inflated and exaggerated and rejected his claim that his expenses exceeded his income and that he did not have sufficient funds to maintain the child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Wife submitted the following computation for

Food</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Wife had not shown how the $500 was derived. Based on invoices tendered, the obvious one was an invoice for monthly purchases from the Mothercare store for $503 which included the purchase of a car seat<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. I deducted $170 for purchase of a car seat, and added another invoice of $43.81 to give $377 as the monthly maintenance for the child rounded up to $400 as monthly maintenance to provide for buffer for additional items such as replacement of the car seat, etc<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 2. Medical Insurance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The sum claimed was $205.56 which I rounded up to $206. As the policies were meant to provide for the child, I allowed this expense item as part of the child’s maintenance. The Defendant agreed with this expense item. However, the Husband raised a concern on one of the 3 policies, the AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Arising from a query by me at the 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing on 15 May 2025, the Wife’s solicitor clarified by his letter of 22 May 2025, that this item comprised of the following policies which were payable annually:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     AIA Healthshield Max B (Hospitalisation) - $249.31.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     AIA Max VitalHealth B (Hospitalisation) - $195.81.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV) with critical illness rider - $2,017.50 ($1,185 + $832.50 Rider Premium).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The total for all 3 policies came to $2,462.62 per year or $205.22 monthly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband’s solicitor, in his letter of 22 May 2025 informed that the 3<sup>rd</sup> policy “<em>is a life insurance policy which name the (Wife) as the sole owner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span>. Therefore, the payout or any surrender value (should the (Wife) decide to surrender the policy at any time as is her right as the sole policy owner) will go to only the (Wife) in the event of Death, Total Permanent Disability, and Critical Illness. In the event of any untoward event that happens to the child, the attendant expenses will be borne equally between the parties, regardless of the quantum of the payout under this policy or to whom the payout is made</em>”. The Husband was thus of the view that the child’s interest is safeguarded without requiring this policy or for half the costs which was to be borne by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The Husband’s point was that the policy was not a wealth accumulation plan but to provide coverage for Death, Permanent Disability and Critical Illness and while the main policy has a surrender value, the surrender value would only surpass the total premiums paid after at least 30 years into the policy. I found the Husband’s concern a valid one. To address this, I made the following additional order in respect of item 2 which included the insurance policy concerned:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the event of any payout or surrender of the AIA Guaranteed Protect Plus (IV)being made to the Wife instead of for the benefit of the child, the Wife shall handover 50% of the amounts received to the Husband with 14 days of such receipt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 3. Medical and Dental</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It was submitted by the Husband that these were being paid under the parties’ employment benefit. In view of that I made separate orders for such payments. For the medical and dental expenses, I ordered that the Husband pays 50% of the expenses not claimable by any of the parties’ employment benefit, payable on reimbursement basis within 7 days of any request to pay from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 4. Utilities</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I reduced the amount claimed from $100 to $60 for the child since for the helper, an adult, I assessed $100 as a reasonable amount. Further, on weekdays the child would be in pre-school half the time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Item 5. Books, Diapers, Baby Bibs, Wet Wipes, Clothes, Shoes, Vitamins, Supplements</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     As the child had grown older, some items such as bibs and diapers need not be purchased. I allocated $200 as a reasonable amount as the Wife also had to purchase new clothes and shoes as the child grows older.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The total for child expenses child excluding medical and dental expenses came to $433.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Items 6 to 13. Helper related expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I found the quantum claimed justified. The total amount for all the items came to $1,541. However, since the child was in pre-school during half of the weekdays, the helper would likely be doing other household chores for the Wife. In view of that, I attributed 80% of the total $1,541 to the child which is $1,232. 50% of this amount was to be paid by Husband which came to $616.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The total maintenance payable by the Husband for the child’s maintenance came to $1,049 ($433 plus $616) and rounded up to $1,050, to be paid with effect from 1 June 2025.

The account was topped up by the parties whenever it got low.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Husband confirmed the above arrangements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. With respect to the Household Account, although it was in the Wife’s name, they had always treated it as a joint account, as the common understanding was that the monies in the Household Account were also to be used for household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Wife further stated that throughout the marriage, she had suggested to the Husband a couple of times to do “combined investments” but he did not want to do so and informed her that he much preferred to do his own separate investments<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. The Wife was fine with this. It also dawned on her that another reason that the Husband wanted to keep his finances separate was because he wanted the financial freedom to do what he wanted such as gambling at poker, drinking, and by keeping his finances separate, she did not get to track his finances at all.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Husband confirmed that the Wife did suggest that they make “combined investments”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>. However, he was not keen to do so and preferred to do his separate investments as “combined investments” did not present any additional financial benefits when compared to making separate investments. They also had different investment strategies, and he did not want to create more conflict between them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In relation to the insurance policies, when the Wife suggested investing together such as purchasing a wealth accumulation insurance policy as a form of education savings and planning for the child, the Husband vehemently disagreed and told her that when it was time, they could just contribute the necessary amounts required for the child’s education<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband also confirmed that the Wife did suggest purchasing a wealth accumulation insurance policy for the child but was insistent on accumulating an excess of $1 million for that purpose whereas he preferred to invest in a diversified and balanced portfolio of various instruments which could accumulate more wealth for both the child’s educational and the household needs<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     Based on the above evidence, on behalf of the Wife, it was submitted that all the investments made by each party were from their respective income which were never shared with each other and kept separate. One example given was that the Wife did not know about the large sums that the Husband spent on gambling and that he had indulged in cryptocurrency investments which the Wife considered as risky. The Wife also claimed that the Husband had not been financially prudent in managing his assets as he had used his personal income for his own gambling hobbies and other investments without the Wife’s knowledge. Each of them did not make any financial or non-financial contribution towards their respective accumulation of assets/investments. As such it would be unfair and inequitable for the Husband to have a share in the Wife’s investments which were all kept separate in the same manner that the Husband had kept his separate to himself. Each party thus should retain all other assets in their respective names and that only the Apartment should be divided.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Wife relied on section 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 to support her contention that in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1), the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case. Section 112 reads:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">112.—(1)    The court has power, when granting or subsequent to the grant of a judgment of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    the extent of the contributions made by each party in money, property or work towards acquiring, improving or maintaining the matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    any debt owing or obligation incurred or undertaken by either party for their joint benefit or for the benefit of any child of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    the needs of the children (if any) of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    the extent of the contributions made by each party to the welfare of the family, including looking after the home or caring for the family or any aged or infirm relative or dependant of either party;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    any agreement between the parties with respect to the ownership and division of the matrimonial assets made in contemplation of divorce;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(f)    any period of rent-free occupation or other benefit enjoyed by one party in the matrimonial home to the exclusion of the other party;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    the giving of assistance or support by one party to the other party (whether or not of a material kind), including the giving of assistance or support which aids the other party in the carrying on of his or her occupation or business; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(h)    the matters referred to in section 114(1) so far as they are relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The provision empowers the court to order the division of assets upon divorce. The Wife relied on the case of <em>Ong Boon Huat Samuel v Chan Mei Lan Kristine</em> [2007] 2 SLR (R) 729, wherein the Court of Appeal said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“26.  Thus, it is not mandatory for the court to exercise its powers of division under s 112 and the court may generally decline to do so where a valid reason is given: <em>Wong Kam Fong Anne v Ang Ann Liang</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1992] 3 SLR(R) 0902.xml')\">[1992] 3 SLR(R) 902</a> at [31]. For the reasons given above, the present case is one in which there is good reason for the court not to divide Malvern Springs.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In Ong Boon Huat Samuel’s case, the wife who originally agreed to purchase a property with the husband withdrew her consent after they separated and left the purchase to the husband to purchase it in his own name. The wife’s application to have a share of the property failed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Having considered the evidence and the law, I found merits in the Wife’s arguments. However, I was of the view that only the investment items should be left in the parties’ sole name and these comprised of the shares, unit trust and insurance policies for the Wife and for the Husband, the shares, unit trust and his cryptocurrency investments. The following were to be retained by the parties in their own names and not liable for division:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"35.16%\"><col width=\"32.86%\"><col width=\"31.98%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife ($)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband ($)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Shares</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">56,234.52</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1,255.38</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Unit Trusts</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">34,183.37</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3,425.89</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Surrender values of insurance policies</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">138,339.46</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Cryptocurrency investments</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">37,789.08</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$228,757.35</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$42,470.35</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Assets to be divided</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In determining the division of assets, I followed the approach set out in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a>, which stipulated a structured approach (at [22]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Using the structured approach, the court could first ascribe a ratio that represents each party’s direct contributions relative to that of the other party, having regard to the amount of financial contribution each party has made towards the acquisition or improvement of the matrimonial assets. Next, to give credit to both parties’ indirect contribution throughout the marriage, instead of giving the party who has contributed more significantly than the other an ‘uplift’ to his or her direct contribution percentage, the court should proceed to ascribe a second ratio to represent each party’s indirect contribution to the well-being of the family relative to that of the other. Using each party’s respective direct and indirect percentage contributions, the court then derives each party’s average percentage contribution to the family which would form the basis to divide the matrimonial assets. Further adjustments (to take into account, <em>inter alia</em>, the other factors enumerated in s 112(2) of the WC) may need to be made to the parties’ average percentage contributions …</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Court of Appeal further elaborated that indirect contributions, being a question of impression and judgment, is not to be determined mathematically but based on “all the relevant facts” of the case (at [24]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The following assets, in addition to the Apartment, were added to the total pool of assets for distribution which included the legal fees paid out by each party to their solicitors prior to interim judgment:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.6532693461308%\"><col width=\"33.1733653269346%\"><col width=\"33.1733653269346%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Wife ($)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Husband ($)</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Bank accounts</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">86,318.43</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">73,981.89-UOB One</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0.24 -

The actual property was inspected and valuation was done at $2.6 million<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>. The Wife also informed that in November 2024, a similar unit was transacted at $2,508,00.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Husband got another valuation done by Valuer 2 and produced a valuation report dated 2 May 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>. The valuer claimed that he inspected the subject property on 15 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I noted that the report of Valuer 2 referred to another unit on the same floor which was stated as having a concrete structure in an off-centre location of the living room which could not be removed or demolished and thus reduced the useable area. Without giving an assessment of the valuation of that unit, the valuer concluded that the parties’ unit is valued at $2,685,000. I found his comparison to the other unit and the parties’ unit perplexing. The valuer would be more convincing if he had valued the other unit first and then opined that the parties’ unit would be worth more as it did not have that structure. The valuer’s method made the final valuation figure arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     In view of the above observations, I accepted the Wife’s valuer’s valuation of $2.6 million.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">ii)   Outstanding loan</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The Apartment was purchased on 18 April 2019 for a sum of $1.8 million with stamp duty paid amounting to $56,000. It was purchased in the Wife’s sole name prior to the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     A mortgage loan of $700,000 was taken up by the Wife and an initial loan of $951,197 was given by the Wife’s parents for the purchase. Both parties executed a loan agreement with the Wife’s parents on the loan taken from the Wife’s parents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     The Wife used her CPF monies towards the repayments of the mortgage loan.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In October 2022, the Wife’s parents extended a further loan of $510,000 which was used to partially redeem the mortgage loan on 21 October 2022 which amounted to $636,160.34.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Whilst parties had repaid the parents for the loan during the marriage, the outstanding loan to the Wife’s parents, according to the Wife, stood at $816,000 as at the date of the ancillary hearing. The Husband disputed that the amount was $816,000 and claimed that the amount should be $616,000.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">$200,000 purported as a gift to the Wife by parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife maintained a loan spreadsheet relating to the Apartment<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>. On 22 October 2022, there was a record of the Wife having made a repayment of $200,000 for the loans made by the parents. The Husband submitted that there were no such transactions in any of the Wife’s bank accounts and claimed that the Wife had an undisclosed bank account. The Husband invited the Court to draw an adverse inference against the Wife for the non-disclosure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     The law on drawing adverse inferences was succinctly summarised by the Court of Appeal in <em>Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai Huah</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/52834-M.xml')\">[2007] SGCA 21</a> at [28] and followed in subsequent cases including <em>BPC v BPB and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/23037-SSP.xml')\">[2019] 1 SLR 608</a>. In order for the court to draw an adverse inference, there must be:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_a\"></a>(a)     a substratum of evidence that establishes a prima facie case against the person against whom the inference is to be drawn; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_65-p2_b\"></a>(b)     that person must have had some particular access to the information he is said to be hiding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Further, when informed that the $200,000 deduction was made as the Wife’s parents had gifted her 2 separate sums of $100,000, the Husband claimed that the $200,000 were also gifted to him and should be shared.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The issue to be determined was whether the Wife had undisclosed bank account and whether the $200,000 gifted by the Wife’s parents to the Wife was intended to be shared with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Wife disclosed that a $100,000 gift was given to her by her parents on account of their 37<sup>th</sup> anniversary on 17 January 2023 and a further $100,000 by her father on his 61<sup>st</sup> birthday in March 2023. Her father had asked that these 2 gifts be reflected into the loan spreadsheet to be dated 14 March 2023. The Wife indicated the $200,000 loan to her parents as being paid as at 22 October 2022 in the loan spreadsheet.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     She explained that these two gifts were non-cash transactions to her which were set off against the outstanding parent’s loans extended and thus not reflected in her bank statements. She produced her father’s WhatsApp message of 17 January 2023 which was sent only to her and another WhatsApp message for the next $100,000 gift<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     On the evidence, I accepted the Wife’s version as to how the $200,000 came about. I found it unlikely that the Wife’s parents had intended that the $200,000 be a gift to be shared with the Husband. If so, her parents would have also sent the same WhatsApp message or a separate one to the Husband but that was not the case here. The messages also clearly indicated that the gift was for the Wife solely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     On the evidence, I was also satisfied that there was no undisclosed bank account as alleged by the Husband. As such I declined to draw any adverse inference against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">iii)   Account for wedding monies received </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Husband also sought to have the monies (referred to as “Ang Pows”) received by the Wife at their wedding held in 2019, to be included in the pool of assets. According to her, parties had also agreed to keep their respective wedding gifts and continue to hold separate accounts for their respective personal assets. They had agreed to have separate boxes for monies gifted at their wedding and to keep the monies received separate.

In deciding the indirect contributions, I came to the following views:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_i\"></a>i)     The Wife was the main caregiver of the child from birth till interim judgment, that is, from 2 April 2023 to 20 May 2024, which was slightly over 1 year, even if the presence of the helper should be taken into account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_ii\"></a>ii)     During the marriage and before the child was born, the Wife’s indirect contributions were more than the Husband’s from a comparison of the accounts given by both in their respective affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii\"></a>iii)     The Wife should also be given credit for her efforts in acquiring the Apartment which has appreciated in value from the purchase price of $1.8 million to $2.6 million which the Husband also stood to benefit from. In this respect, I noted the following efforts made by the Wife:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii-p3_a\"></a>a)       The Wife’s sole determination to purchase the property despite the Husband’s reluctance as he was only willing to purchase either a cheaper condominium or a public flat (a Housing and Development Board flat). He had stated that the Wife insisted of a property which has also potential for capital appreciation. She had bought the property in her sole name and also took the risk of taking the maximum loan possible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_75-p2_iii-p3_b\"></a>b)       Parties could not afford the apartment on their respective incomes but through the Wife’s sole effort, she managed to obtain a substantial interest free loan from her parents. The Husband disclosed that the Wife had unilaterally discussed with her parents the issue of financial aid from them, the form such financial aid would take, and eventually the terms of the loans from her parents. Her parents loaned them $951,197 for the apartment. Her efforts saved the parties interest payments of $160,000 for the 5 years<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     In relation to property investment decisions, in <em>UJF v UJG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/21382-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGHCF 1</a>, the party concerned was given credit as indirect contributions (at [108]). In that case, the Wife was the party who was primarily involved in making property investment decisions. The Court stated (at [109]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The exercise of these skills on a general basis throughout the marriage is to my mind sufficient to qualify as “indirect financial contributions” (see <em>ANJ v ANK</em> at [24]). I am not aware of any case law that would point against this. Recognising such decision-making as a form of indirect contribution, captures the effort and skill exercised by the spouse in question, which contributes to the welfare and prosperity of the family just as much as other efforts. But it should be borne in mind that not all such decisions would necessarily be recognised; much will depend on facts, including the number of occasions of the decision-making or deliberation, and the amount involved each time. One-off decisions, or a few decisions done over a long period of time, is unlikely to qualify for recognition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     While the marriage was short lived and lasted 4 years 7 months to the time of the interim judgment, based on the above, the Wife’s indirect contributions in acquiring the matrimonial home was significant and with her other indirect contributions, I assessed them to be 60% with most part of it being attributed to her efforts in securing the Apartment and the interest free loans from her parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

flat”). The PH submits that the value should be $980,000 while the DW submits that the value should be $910,888. The PH relies on the highest transacted price of $970,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> in June 2024 for a flat on a similar floor. I find the PH’s value to be unrealistically high given that even in 2024, there were similar flats at a similar floor which sold at a much lower price of $910,888 (see transaction in July 2024)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_36\" id=\"Ftn_36_1\"><sup>[note: 36]</sup></a></span>. There is also no reason why the matrimonial flat should be valued higher than the highest transacted price of $970,000. A more realistic value would be to take the average price of $910,888 and $970,000, which would work out to $940,444.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Inclusion of PH’s luxury watches (S/No. 9 and 10 of Table 1)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In relation to the PH’s luxury watches, the PH does not dispute the DW’s values which are based on the purchase price of the watches. However, PH takes the position that the watches should be excluded from the matrimonial pool<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span>. The PH argues that both parties should retain their respective luxury items. His position is that the DW has failed to make full disclosure of all luxury items in her possession. He also takes the view that the values are de minimis (amounting to a mere 3% of the assets). The DW disagrees and submits that both parties’ luxury items should be included in the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I do not accept the PH’s submission to exclude both parties’ luxury items from the matrimonial pool. First, I disagree with PH that items with values amounting to 3% of the asset pool are considered de minimis. The value of both parties’ disclosed luxury items exceeds $50,000, which would hardly be considered de minimis in an asset pool of $1.2 million. Second, the PH’s contention that there is non-disclosure on the DW’s part is unsubstantiated. Even if the PH is to prove that there is non-disclosure, the appropriate remedy is to draw an adverse inference against the DW rather than to exclude what are clearly matrimonial assets from the pool. Finally and more importantly, both parties accept that the luxury items were purchased during the course of the marriage. In other words, the items were purchased using matrimonial funds. It would therefore follow that the luxury items should be included in the matrimonial pool for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Inclusion of 50% of the DW’s Bank of China fixed deposit account (S/No. 19 of Table 1)</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The DW had a fixed deposit account (ending with 3504) in the Bank of China (“FD account”) in her sole name at the time of IJ. The balance as at the date of IJ was $100,000. However, as of the date of the Ancillary hearing, the FD account was no longer in the DW’s name. The DW admits that she transferred the full sum of $102,902 to her mother when the fixed deposit matured in November 2024. The DW’s mother subsequently placed the same monies in another fixed deposit account (also in the Bank of China) in her own name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Parties’ respective positions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The PH submits that 50% of the monies in the FD account to be matrimonial asset since the DW concedes that the monies in the FD account partially came from the monies in a bank account which was then jointly held by the DW and her mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span>. The DW takes the position that 100% of the monies in the FD account belong to her mother and was rightfully returned to the mother<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Burden of proof</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The DW submits that the PH bears the burden of proof to establish that the monies in the FD account were matrimonial assets. She further submits that the PH has failed to prove that he contributed to the funds in the FD account and accordingly, the FD account should be excluded from the matrimonial pool<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the PH argues that the onus is on the DW to prove that the FD account which is in the DW’s name should be excluded from division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I agree with the PH’s submission that the DW bears the evidentiary burden of proof. PH refers to the Court of Appeal’s case of <em>USB v UBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“USB”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span>, which states in [31]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“When a marriage is dissolved, in general all the parties’ assets will be treated as matrimonial assets unless a party is able to prove that any particular asset ……. is [therefore] not a matrimonial asset. The party who asserts that an asset is not a matrimonial asset or that only a part of its value should be included in the pool bears the burden of proving this on the balance of probabilities.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Although <em>USB</em> involves different issues (pre-marital assets which continue to be financed using matrimonial monies), the Court of Appeal’s pronouncement in relation to the burden of proof where a party asserts that a personal asset is not a matrimonial asset is directly applicable in the present case. As of IJ date, the FD account was in the DW’s sole name. Following the case of <em>USB</em>, the bank account would be considered a matrimonial asset unless the DW proves that the monies did not belong to her. The question of whether PH has contributed the monies is not relevant at the stage of determining if the FD account is a matrimonial asset. The PH’s contribution to the FD account is only relevant if the monies are considered matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The DW’s submissions on the evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The source of funds for the FD account is explained by the DW in her own affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_42\" id=\"Ftn_42_1\"><sup>[note: 42]</sup></a></span>, and subsequently by the DW’s mother (“DM”) first in a signed statement (“DM’s statement”) exhibited in DAM-2<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_43\" id=\"Ftn_43_1\"><sup>[note: 43]</sup></a></span> and subsequently in DM’s 2 affidavits<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span>. The explanations differ slightly and these differences are detailed below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The DW in her DAM-1<sup>39</sup> explains that the monies in the FD account came from a UOB account which was jointly held by the DW and the DM (“joint UOB account”), without mention of any other sources of funds. On the other hand, in DM’s statement, the DM mentions that the DW’s BOC monies came from a combination of the joint UOB account and the DM’s own FD monies (“DM’s FD”) which was also held in BOC<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_45\" id=\"Ftn_45_1\"><sup>[note: 45]</sup></a></span>. In the subsequent DM-1, the DM claims that only $3,000 came from the joint UOB account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_46\" id=\"Ftn_46_1\"><sup>[note: 46]</sup></a></span>. In the same affidavit, the DM explains that the FD account was opened in the DW’s sole name so that the DW could take advantage of the preferential rates for online transactions and cites her unfamiliarity with online banking as the reason<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_47\" id=\"Ftn_47_1\"><sup>[note: 47]</sup></a></span>. The DM does not provide the reasons for her instructions to close the FD account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Examining the evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The DW produces a letter from UOB which shows that the joint UOB account was closed on 16 February 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_48\" id=\"Ftn_48_1\"><sup>[note: 48]</sup></a></span>. The evidence shows that the FD account was opened on 16 February 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_49\" id=\"Ftn_49_1\"><sup>[note: 49]</sup></a></span> which coincided with the closing of the joint UOB account. I therefore accept the DW’s submission that the monies in the UOB were likely transferred to the FD account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     However, there is no evidence of the closing balance of the joint UOB account and therefore no evidence of the amount transferred to the FD account. According to the DW, UOB could not provide the closing balance as the account was a passbook account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     At the same time, there is also no evidence that the DM had transferred monies from DM’s FD to the FD account. The DM merely provides an account balance sheet which shows DM’s past deposits with the Bank of China<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_50\" id=\"Ftn_50_1\"><sup>[note: 50]</sup></a></span> under DM’s sole name. However, the DM does not explain or provide evidence of the flow of funds from DM’s FD to the FD account. In short, neither the DW nor the DM is able to prove that the funds in the FD account mostly came from the DM.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     At the same time, I find the DW’s use of the FD account to be inconsistent with her claim that the FD account was held on trust for DM. The DW’s first mention of the FD account is in DAM-1 when she explains that the monies were used to fund her (DW’s) legal fees<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_51\" id=\"Ftn_51_1\"><sup>[note: 51]</sup></a></span>. This statement suggests that the DW, in fact, had liberal access to the funds in the FD account. Additionally, it is rather unusual to utilise a fixed deposit account for a loan since the funds in a fixed deposit account is not readily available or accessible unless one is prepared to forgo all interest which will only accrue on maturity. In contrast, savings accounts offer high liquidity. It is also noted that the DM herself has substantial funds in her personal savings accounts. As it turns out, the DW did not utilise any of the monies in the FD account and the full amount with interests was “returned” to the DM on xx November 2024 about 4 months after the IJ when the FD matured.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given the above analysis, I am of the view that the DW has not proven on a balance of probability that the FD account solely belongs to the DM. As the DW has conceded that the FD account included the monies from the joint UOB account without evidence as to exact amount, the FD account is considered jointly contributed by the DW and the DM. In this regard, I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that half of the balance in the FD account should be included in the pool for division. However, given that the bank account balances should be valued as at IJ date, the value of the FD account at the material time will exclude the interest component (which is only earned upon maturity). Accordingly, $50,000 (being 50% of the principal sum of $100,000) is returned to the pool for division.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ liabilities </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The PH’s liabilities are set out in Table 2a.

Second, he contends that the monies expended is to be considered as the DW’s contributions, and not a loan<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_58\" id=\"Ftn_58_1\"><sup>[note: 58]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I first consider the source of funds for the sum of $13,000. I accept that the sum of $13,000 came from the DW’s sole bank account in view of the payment document showing the remittance of $13,000 from the DW to the car dealer<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_59\" id=\"Ftn_59_1\"><sup>[note: 59]</sup></a></span>. At the hearing, the PH’s counsel also concedes that the monies came from the DW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     However, I am of the view that the DW has failed to prove that the monies were intended to be a loan to the PH. There is no documentary evidence of the alleged loan. While I accept that given parties’ spousal relationship, the absence of a written agreement is not conclusive, there is also no evidence of the DW taking steps to recover the alleged loan. This is despite the passage of time (since 2020) and the fact that the same vehicle has since been sold and replaced with 2 other vehicles. Given the lack of evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, I am not convinced that parties had intended the sum of $13,000 to be a loan from the DW to the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In any event, a claim for the return of an inter-spousal loan should be disregarded for the purposes of a s112 Women’s Charter division. First, a division under s112 of the Charter is not the appropriate forum to determine what is in essence a civil claim (see case of <em>AZZ v BAA</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_60\" id=\"Ftn_60_1\"><sup>[note: 60]</sup></a></span>). Second, an inter-spousal loan does not change the size of the matrimonial pool for division, unlike a loan to a third party. The High Court case of <em>UYP v UYQ</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_61\" id=\"Ftn_61_1\"><sup>[note: 61]</sup></a></span> explains:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Under the regime in s 112 of the Women’s Charter, the assets of both parties acquired during marriage are pooled together as “matrimonial assets”. Thus the source of the loans, if acquired by one party to the marriage, would have been [matrimonial assets]. An inter-spousal loan would not result in a change in the size of the overall [matrimonial asset] pool, because the loan moneys would merely be transferred from one party to the other.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As the sum of $13,000 is not to be considered as a loan to be returned to DW, the question arises as to how this sum should be treated under the s112 of the Charter. The DW argues that the sum of $13,000 should be considered as her direct contributions towards the Mercedes. On the other hand, the PH argues that the expended sum should be taken as the DW’s indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I prefer the PH’s position as there is no evidence showing how the injection of $13,000 to the Volkswagen translates to her direct contribution first to the Nissan (following the trade-in of the Volkswagen) and subsequently to the Mercedes. Given such limitations, the PH’s position that the sum of $13,000 should be considered as indirect contribution is reasonable. This follows the approach taken in the case of <em>UZK v UZL</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_62\" id=\"Ftn_62_1\"><sup>[note: 62]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ direct financial contributions to the matrimonial flat </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I next move on to the parties’ respective direct contributions to the flat, being the only substantive jointly held asset between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The parties collected the keys to the matrimonial flat sometime in 2016 and started living there in May 2018. Both parties agree that the costs of renovations and fittings (“renovation costs”) was around $45,000<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_63\" id=\"Ftn_63_1\"><sup>[note: 63]</sup></a></span>. However, both parties claim that they had contributed the lion share towards the renovation costs although neither party is able to submit the supporting evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I shall first examine the PH’s position, which appears to be both unclear and ambiguous. On one hand, the PH admits that the parties shared the renovation costs, furniture and electric appliances<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_64\" id=\"Ftn_64_1\"><sup>[note: 64]</sup></a></span>. At the same time, the PH also asserts in the same affidavit that he paid for the lion share of the parties joint account, from which the renovation costs were paid<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_65\" id=\"Ftn_65_1\"><sup>[note: 65]</sup></a></span>. In respect of the parties’ financial arrangements during the period when the renovation costs were expended, the PH provided the following explanation<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_66\" id=\"Ftn_66_1\"><sup>[note: 66]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>a)     The parties lived at the DW’s mother’s flat after marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>b)     The PH passed all his income (including bonuses) to the DW during that period and only took an allowance for his daily expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>c)     At the DW’s request, the PH deposited his salaries into the joint account between the DW and her mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     According to the PH, the above arrangement (“initial financial arrangement”) continued until parties came to a subsequent agreement to each contribute $800 to the parties’ joint account (conveniently referred to as the “joint contribution arrangement”). Consequentially, the PH, in his written submissions, suggests that he should be credited with 2/3 of the renovation costs<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_67\" id=\"Ftn_67_1\"><sup>[note: 67]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The PH also argues that the DW has more savings despite earning less than the PH, which would suggest that the DW has saved a large part of her income. The PH points out that the DW has admitted to saving 15% of her income<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_68\" id=\"Ftn_68_1\"><sup>[note: 68]</sup></a></span>. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the PH has contributed more than the DW towards the joint account which was in turn used to finance the family’s expenses (including the renovation costs)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_69\" id=\"Ftn_69_1\"><sup>[note: 69]</sup></a></span>. For convenience, I refer to this argument as the “income-savings ratio argument”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     On the DW’s part, she disputes the PH’s account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_70\" id=\"Ftn_70_1\"><sup>[note: 70]</sup></a></span> specifically (a) that the PH’s entire income and bonus was given to DW (b) that the PH credited his income into the DW’s joint account with her mother. The DW maintains that she has financed a large part of the family’s expenses (including the renovation costs) using her personal bank account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_71\" id=\"Ftn_71_1\"><sup>[note: 71]</sup></a></span>. She argues that she contributed $25,000 from her personal bank account towards the renovations. She does not directly address the income-savings ratio argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     As mentioned above, there is no evidence to prove either party’s version, both in respect of the source of funds and their versions of the initial financial arrangement. I further note that the PH maintained rather contradictory claims as to how he, on one hand, handed over the entire salary (save for a small allowance) to the DW and yet at the same time deposited his salary into the DW’s and the mother’s joint account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am also not persuaded by the PH’s income-savings ratio argument. Although the evidence shows that the DW has more savings despite a lower income, this fact alone does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the DW had contributed less towards the joint account or family expenses. First, the PH’s argument is premised on the assumption that both parties had equal savings when the parties registered their marriage. Given the PH’s own admission that the DW started work before he did (and therefore had more CPF in her account)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_72\" id=\"Ftn_72_1\"><sup>[note: 72]</sup></a></span>, this assumption may not necessarily be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Second, the PH’s submission overlooks several crucial factors that influence accumulated savings beyond income and respective contributions to family expenses. These factors include the parties’ saving and spending patterns, as well as their distinct approaches to investment. In the present case, the DW and PH do not seem to share similar spending and saving patterns. The DW candidly admits that she has a habit of saving 15% of her income. She explains that her voluntary CPF top-ups serve as a means to reduce her tax liabilities. Additionally, DW has a habit of investing her monies as seen from her Central Depository Private Limited (“CDP”) portfolio. In contrast, the PH does not have own any shares or have any shares account. At the same time, the PH does not seem to have a similar mindset regarding savings. According to DW, she had in the past advised the PH to adopt the practice of making voluntary CPF top-ups to reap the same tax reliefs but the PH “does not listen”. The parties’ personal assets similarly reflect the parties’ different approaches towards savings and investments, with insurance policies and shares comprising more than half of the DW’s personal assets. On the other hand, the PH’s personal assets are mostly made up of luxury watches. Given the foregoing, I am not persuaded by the income-savings ratio argument.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As there is no evidence of the parties’ contributions towards the renovation costs, I had applied the broad-brush approach to divide the renovation costs equally between both parties. In arriving at this conclusion, I have given significant weight to the joint contribution arrangement which the parties had during the marriage. Although the renovation expenses were incurred prior to the arrangement, the fact that parties agreed on equal contribution (despite the difference in their incomes) suggests that the parties’ contributions prior to the arrangement were not far from that proportion. In the absence of contrary evidence, it is more reasonable to split the renovation costs equally between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Accordingly, the parties’ direct contributions towards the matrimonial pool are set out in Table 3 below:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 3</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"38.7877575515103%\"><col width=\"30.2860572114423%\"><col width=\"30.9261852370474%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PH ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DW ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">CPF (principal) paid towards the flat</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">183,936.36</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">146,942.64</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Renovations of $45,000</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">½ of 45,000 = 22,500</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">½ of 45,000 = 22,500</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Parties’ personal assets in their sole names </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">306,582.09</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">336,845.50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Less: liabilities</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(68,003.61)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">0</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Total </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">238,578.48</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">336,845.50</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Parties’ respective direct financial contributions </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">445,014.84 (46.8%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">506,288.14 (53.2%)</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect contributions </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     This is a 10-year marriage with 2 children. The PH submits that he should be awarded 50% as his indirect contributions. According to the PH, he paid for the majority of the family’s expenses. Additionally, he did most of the household chores, took charge of the renovations and organised family celebrations and holidays. Finally, he was also heavily involved in caring for the children and was a hands-on father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On the other hand, the DW submits that she should be awarded 95% as her indirect contributions. She has always been the children’s primary caregiver and has had to sacrifice her career progression due to the family. She has contributed financially by paying for the children’s expenses and contributed to the joint account. After the marriage broke down in April 2023, she has had to engage a domestic helper at her own expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     First, I deal with indirect financial contribution. As the parties’ contributions evolved with the change in the family’s living arrangements, I have considered the parties’ financial contribution in 3 distinct timeframes. For the first 3 years after marriage (until sometime in 2017/2018), the parties lived together at the DW’s mother’s flat. The 1<sup>st</sup> child was born during this period. In respect of this period, the parties’ respective positions largely mirror their submissions in respect of their contributions towards the renovation costs. Additionally, during the same period, a monthly allowance of $1,000 was paid to the DW’s mother. Both parties claim to be the one who paid the allowance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_73\" id=\"Ftn_73_1\"><sup>[note: 73]</sup></a></span> but neither party provided evidence. I adopt the same approach as that of the renovation costs and consider the parties’ indirect financial contribution during this period to be equal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Subsequently, the parties moved to the matrimonial flat and resided there until the marriage broke down sometime in April 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_74\" id=\"Ftn_74_1\"><sup>[note: 74]</sup></a></span> when the PH left the matrimonial flat. The 2<sup>nd</sup> child was born during this period. For this period which lasted about 5 years, it is undisputed that the parties largely followed the joint contribution arrangement which entailed both parties contributing equally towards the joint account. It is undisputed that the joint account monies were used to pay for (a) children’s school fees (b) outgoings for the flat such as utilities and (c) miscellaneous expenses like food or clothing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_75\" id=\"Ftn_75_1\"><sup>[note: 75]</sup></a></span>. The parties’ dispute pertains to the expenses which were not paid out of the joint account. The disputed expenses include groceries, eating out, children’s insurance and holidays<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_76\" id=\"Ftn_76_1\"><sup>[note: 76]</sup></a></span>, general household maintenance<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> and family celebrations and activities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_78\" id=\"Ftn_78_1\"><sup>[note: 78]</sup></a></span> pregnancy-related expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span>, car-related expenses and PH’s credit card bills. Both parties agree that the DW paid for the children’s enrichment programmes<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The PH’s position on the disputed expenses can be summarised as follows: (a) he contributed jointly<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span>, and in some cases he contributed jointly because the monies came from the joint accounts<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span> (b) he paid for the majority of the expenses because he earned more<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the DW claims that (a) she paid for all expenses from her personal account (b) the joint contribution was insufficient to cover the excluded expenses. To support her claim, the DW tenders evidence to show payment of insurance policies, groceries, school-related expenses, albeit the evidence relates to payments only between 2023 and 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For this part of the marriage, I find that the DW’s financial contributions to be marginally higher than the PH’s. The evidence suggests that the DW is the one who managed the family’s finances as part of her role of running the household. The DW mentions that she was responsible for (a) paying the household bills<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> (b) paying for the household items and groceries purchased either online or using the FairPrice account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> (c) paying for the children’s school and enrichment expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span> (d) paying for the PH’s car-related expenses and credit card bills<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span>. In the PAM-2, the PH does not disagree that the DW made the payments but claims that the funds came from the parties’ joint account<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span>. In this regard, I note that the PH’s later claim that the joint account was used for the excluded expenses contradicts his initial position which expressly states that the joint contribution arrangement was intended to cover limited expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_89\" id=\"Ftn_89_1\"><sup>[note: 89]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Even if PH’s subsequent position is to be accepted, ie. that the joint account monies were also used to cover the excluded expenses, it is not his case that he contributed more than $800 to the <em>joint</em> account regularly. Instead, the PH makes a general assertion that “During the marriage … the Defendant would request for me to pay for my share (or the entire sum) of the expenses. I would do so without hesitation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_90\" id=\"Ftn_90_1\"><sup>[note: 90]</sup></a></span>” However, the PH’s assertion lacks essential details, such as the mode of payments, their frequency, and their intended purpose. In contrast, the DW consistently maintains that she pays for all the expenses from her personal account and the joint account is insufficient to pay for the family’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_91\" id=\"Ftn_91_1\"><sup>[note: 91]</sup></a></span>. Based on the evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that the DW likely supplemented the family’s expenses with her own funds. Given that the excluded expenses are substantial, I find that the DW’s indirect financial contributions during this period were marginally higher than those of the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I next consider the parties’ contributions for the period from April 2023 when the DW locked the PH out of the matrimonial home after she discovered his alleged infidelity. It is also undisputed that the DW collected monthly rental of $1,000 for 1 year but did not give the PH his share of the rental proceeds. The PH argues that the Court should take into consideration the fact that the DW had enjoyed exclusive occupation of the flat since April 2023<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_92\" id=\"Ftn_92_1\"><sup>[note: 92]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     On the other hand, the DW submits that the PH’s monthly contribution of $800 became irregular after PH moved out<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_93\" id=\"Ftn_93_1\"><sup>[note: 93]</sup></a></span>. In addition, she incurred further expenses when she had to engage a domestic helper in November 2023. Between April and November 2023, she enlisted the help of the PH’s mother to pick up one of the children when she could not manage to pick up both children on time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_94\" id=\"Ftn_94_1\"><sup>[note: 94]</sup></a></span>. The arrangement stopped when she was served with the divorce documents in November 2023. As a result, she had to shoulder the costs of the domestic helper on top of her share of the family’s expenses. To support her claims, the DW submits proof of payment for the domestic helper, the children’s expenses, the children’s insurance premiums and miscellaneous expenses such as clothing and necessities<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_95\" id=\"Ftn_95_1\"><sup>[note: 95]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     I accept the PH’s submission that the DW’s exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and his share of the rental proceeds (which is $6,000) should be considered in the PH’s favour when determining his indirect contributions. I am further of the view that the PH had, for the most part, continued to pay his monthly contribution of $800 although the payments were not always paid in a timely manner<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_96\" id=\"Ftn_96_1\"><sup>[note: 96]</sup></a></span>. The evidence further indicates that his monthly contributions increased to $1,000 in or around July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     At the same time, it is reasonable to assume that the family’s expenses increased when the DW engaged a domestic helper. I also accept that the expense is necessary given the children’s ages (7 and 4 years old) and the fact that the DW works full time. In addition, the DW has had to continue paying for the excluded expenses in the same way as she did prior to the breakdown of the marriage. It is unlikely that the PH’s share of the rental proceeds (an additional sum of $500) would be sufficient to cover the increased expenses. For these reasons, I am of the view that the DW’s contribution during this period is still slightly higher than the PH’s even after taking the PH’s share of the rental proceeds and the DW’s exclusive use of the matrimonial property. Taking into consideration the above matters, including the $13,000 contribution towards the family car, I consider the DW’s overall indirect financial contributions to be marginally higher than the PH’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Indirect non-financial contributions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     As for the parties’ non-financial contributions, both parties claim to have done most of the housework, such as cleaning, washing and laundry, as well as marketing / grocery shopping. The PH submits that he had to do most of the housework because he had very high standards of cleanliness<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_97\" id=\"Ftn_97_1\"><sup>[note: 97]</sup></a></span>. On the other hand, the DW contends that she managed the household chores despite of the PH’s standards<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_98\" id=\"Ftn_98_1\"><sup>[note: 98]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     The DW further submits that she is a supportive wife to the PH. Besides updating his resumes, she also handles his financial matters such as settling his bills. Additionally, she takes on the full responsibility of running the household which frees the PH to attend to his work and social commitments. In contrast, the PH claims that he contributes during the DW’s extended family gatherings and brought the DW’s mother for overseas trips.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     In relation to the childcaring duties, the DW submits that she is the primary caregiver for the children, and manages the children’s daily routines, schooling matters, organises family activities and celebrations. The PH similarly claims to be a hands-on father who was involved in the feeding, changing, bathing and sleep duties<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_99\" id=\"Ftn_99_1\"><sup>[note: 99]</sup></a></span>. He also claims that he would prepare breakfast for the children, fetch the children to and from school, and bring them for outdoor activities, outings, playdates and enrichment. The DW contends that the PH’s claims are exaggerated and his involvement in the children’s daily lives was sporadic at best.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     First, I consider the parties’ indirect non-financial contributions during the period immediately after the marriage when the parties lived together with the DW’s mother. It is undisputed that during this period, the parties received substantial assistance and support from the DW’s mother. Although the PH claims to have assisted in the household chores, his contributions are likely to have been less regular given, considering that he worked 12-hour shifts (which will be elaborated upon below) and the parties were living at the DW’s mother house. In all likelihood, the DW’s mother who was not working did the bulk of the household chores.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     In terms of the childcaring duties, the DW’s mother played a key role in caring for the 1<sup>st</sup> child as both parties worked. However, it is reasonable to conclude that both parties would have been responsible for childcare during nights and weekends when they were not at work. I find that the DW’s indirect contributions outweigh that of the PH in this aspect. Although the PH claims to be a hands-on father, he would be hampered by his working hours. For the most part of the marriage, the PH worked in the oil industry and had to take on shift work. From the evidence, each shift lasts for 12 hours at a stretch and generally alternates between morning and night shifts. Given the PH’s working hours, it is reasonable to expect the DW to take on brunt of the childcaring duties at night or during the weekends when the PH is away at work. Caring for an infant or a young toddler, unlike household chores, is a 24-by-7 job which requires the constant presence of the caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     I next consider the parties’ roles during the period when they were living at the matrimonial home. I accept that the PH likely focused on the household chores as he had higher standards of cleanliness. On the other hand, the DW is likely to have devoted her attention and energies to caring for the toddler and the infant. Additionally, she took charge of the children’s schooling and education arrangements, which the PH does not dispute. At the same time, I accept that both parties undertook other responsibilities when necessary, albeit to a lesser degree. In general, I am of the view that the DW’s contributions during this period continue to outweigh the PH as she had to care for the children’s daily needs after her working hours when the PH was at work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     Lastly, for the period from April 2023, I agree with the DW that her indirect non-financial contributions will far outweigh that of the PH’s. After the PH left the matrimonial home, the DW single-handedly took charge of the household chores and cared for the children. While the PH may be correct in that the DW brought about this situation when she evicted the PH from the matrimonial home, the fact remains that the DW did take on the responsibility of running the household during this period without additional help until December 2023 when the present proceedings started.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In conclusion, I find that the DW’s overall contributions outweigh the PH’s for the reasons above. Additionally, I note that the DW has had to prioritise the family’s needs over her work commitments partially due to the PH’s work schedule and the lack of reliable support which can be activated at short notice. In my view, the appropriate ratio for the parties’ indirect contribution is 65:35 in favour of the DW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Overall contribution ratio </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The parties’ direct and indirect contribution ratios are given equal weight in this case. Neither party submitted otherwise and I find no reason to assign different weightage. Accordingly, the overall division is in table 4 below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 4</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\"

paragraph 1, the net value of the HDB flat at [Property 1] (the “Flat”) is to be divided 41% to the Plaintiff and 59% to the Defendant. The net value is the market price of the flat less the outstanding loan and costs and expenses of the sale.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_C\"></a>C.     The Flat at [Property 1] is to be sold in the open market within 7 months from the date of this Order if the Defendant does not exercise the option in paragraph 4 below, and the sale proceeds shall be utilised to repay the outstanding housing loan, deduct costs and expenses of sale before dividing 41% to the Plaintiff and 59% to the Defendant. Each party is to refund his / her CPF monies utilised for the purchase of the Flat including accrued interest from his / her share of the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_D\"></a>D.     The Defendant shall have the first option to take over the Plaintiff’s share of the Flat, which shall be exercised within 1 month from the date of this Order. In the event that the Defendant exercises the option, the Plaintiff’s share, title and interest in the Flat shall be transferred to the Defendant, other than by way of sale, within 4 months from the date of this Order upon the Defendant paying the Plaintiff his 41% share in the net value of the Flat. The Plaintiff shall refund his CPF monies utilised for the purchase of the Flat, including accrued interest, from the consideration he receives. In the case of a transfer, the Defendant shall bear the costs and expenses of the transfer of the Flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_E\"></a>E.     Each party is to retain assets in their own names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Parties’ incomes </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The PH submits that his gross income is $7,881 monthly, which is calculated based on his 2024 income tax statement. However, he seeks to persuade the Court that a significant part of his earned income comes from overtime and shift work which is non-guaranteed. He highlights that his basic pay is in fact lower than the DW’s<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_100\" id=\"Ftn_100_1\"><sup>[note: 100]</sup></a></span>. It is undisputed that the DW’s income $5,200<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_101\" id=\"Ftn_101_1\"><sup>[note: 101]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I am not persuaded by the PH’s submission that his income should be assessed based on his basic pay rather than his total income. With the exception of 2023, the PH’s income tax statements between 2021 and 2024 show a steady increase in his income of more than $10,000 per year. As for 2023, the PH earned $20,000 more as compared to 2022. The PH explains that his company has a turnaround event every 4 years during which the employees are expected to take on more shift work. Accordingly, the PH’s income for the turnaround years will be higher than usual<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_102\" id=\"Ftn_102_1\"><sup>[note: 102]</sup></a></span>. Even if I disregard PH’s income earned in the turnaround year, I am of the view that the PH draws a steady income in the other years regardless of the variable components in his pay. Therefore, I am unable to accept the PH’s submission that his income is in fact lower than the DW’s.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Accordingly, the parties’ incomes are assessed based on their 2024 income tax statements. To be clear, 2024 is not a turnaround year for the PH. The DW’s income excludes rent as there is no evidence that the tenancy agreement was extended beyond May 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_103\" id=\"Ftn_103_1\"><sup>[note: 103]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>Table 6</em> </p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"0\"><colgroup><col width=\"33.75324935013%\"><col width=\"33.1133773245351%\"><col width=\"33.1333733253349%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>PH ($)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>DW ($)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Gross</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">7,881<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_104\" id=\"Ftn_104_1\"><sup>[note: 104]</sup></a></span></p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,466<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_105\" id=\"Ftn_105_1\"><sup>[note: 105]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Nett (less employee CPF of 20%)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">6,305</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">5173</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Ratio</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">55%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">45%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Wife’s maintenance </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The DW seeks monthly maintenance of $1,500<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_106\" id=\"Ftn_106_1\"><sup>[note: 106]</sup></a></span> which she submits is necessary to meet her reasonable expenses. She asks that the maintenance be paid in a lump sum from the PH’s share of the matrimonial flat. The PH’s position is that the DW is not entitled to maintenance as her income is sufficient to cover her reasonable expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_107\" id=\"Ftn_107_1\"><sup>[note: 107]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Applying the law to the facts</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The case of <em>ATE v ATD</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_108\" id=\"Ftn_108_1\"><sup>[note: 108]</sup></a></span> establishes that the power to order spousal maintenance under section 113 Women’s Charter is supplementary to the division of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The facts presented in this case do not substantiate the DW’s claim for spousal maintenance. First, the parties’ marriage is not considered a long marriage as the parties were married for just under 10 years. The DW is also a working mother, who remained gainfully employed throughout marriage. She claims that she had to put her career on a back burner to focus on her family. In this regard, her sacrifice has been considered as part of her contributions towards the family in the division of the matrimonial assets. The DW is relatively young and has many more productive years ahead as a career woman. Although she has made career sacrifices for her family, her income, being only marginally lower than the PH’s, indicates that her skillset remains marketable and relevant in the job market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     Furthermore, the DW will receive cash of over $200,000 from the sale of the matrimonial property in addition to keeping her personal assets. I am of the view that she will have sufficient financial resources to maintain herself. Lastly, I agree with the PH that the DW’s income is sufficient to pay for her own personal expenses.

id=\"\"></a> <u>Monthly allowance for DW’s mother</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     I have excluded DW’s monthly allowance for her mother. From the mother’s bank statements<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_111\" id=\"Ftn_111_1\"><sup>[note: 111]</sup></a></span>, her mother has savings of at least over $300,000 in her bank accounts and will be able to support herself without assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s personal savings</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I have excluded the personal savings of $800. I accept that the DW has a habit of saving a fair portion of her monies. However, the PH should not be required to pay maintenance calculated based on expenses which include the savings component. To award maintenance on this basis will indirectly result in the PH contributing to the DW’s personal savings after the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s insurance premiums</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     The PH submits that the DW’s insurance premiums should be excluded from her monthly expenses as the DW’s insurance policies have an investment or savings component. I agree with the PH’s position in this regard. The DW’s insurance expense per month is $630. This adds up to $7,560 per year. From the list of the insurance policies, most of the policies have a significant surrender value. Similar to savings, insurance policies which have a savings or investment component should be disregarded from the DW’s expense list. At the same time, I note that the DW has insurance policies which do not seem to have an investment or savings component, eg. HSBC Life Shield Plan B/Enhanced Care and Singlife CareShield standard<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_112\" id=\"Ftn_112_1\"><sup>[note: 112]</sup></a></span>. As there is insufficient evidence as to the premiums payable for the policies without an investment or savings component, I adopt the PH’s own insurance expense (ie. $158) given that the PH has found the same amount to be a reasonable expense for himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Helper-related expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     The PH’s position is that the sum of $1,000 is sufficient to cover all expenses related to the domestic helper, including the levy, medical bills and living expenses. The DW’s claim is $1,250. I am of the view that $1,200 is a reasonable sum and includes the renewal or replacement fees for a domestic helper which is generally incurred after the end of the 2-year employment contract. From the DW’s documents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_113\" id=\"Ftn_113_1\"><sup>[note: 113]</sup></a></span>, the charges for engaging a helper is in the region of $2,300 which works out as a monthly average of $100 over 24 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Total household expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     As stated in the table, certain expenses are categorised as household expenses and split equally between the DW and the children. The total household expenses come up to 1,877. This works out to be $626 per person per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance for children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     The PH’s position is that each party should bear the children’s reasonable expenses equally. According to the PH, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses are $1,266 and $1,245. He proposes to pay $1,250 for both children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     The DW’s claim is for PH to pay maintenance of $1,200 for each child<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_114\" id=\"Ftn_114_1\"><sup>[note: 114]</sup></a></span>. She submits that the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_115\" id=\"Ftn_115_1\"><sup>[note: 115]</sup></a></span> are $1,923 and $1,277 respectively but without the children’s share of the household expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Apportionment of the parties’ contributions</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The PH argues that the parties should bear the children’s reasonable expenses equally. The PH finds support for his position in the High Court case of <em>TBC v TBD</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_116\" id=\"Ftn_116_1\"><sup>[note: 116]</sup></a></span>. Briefly, the Court in the case of <em>TBC</em> ordered the parties to contribute equally towards the child’s expenses despite the significant difference between the parties’ incomes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     On the other hand, although not explicitly mentioned, the DW seems to take the position that the PH should pay a larger proportion of the children’s reasonable expenses as seen from her claims vis-à-vis the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The case of <em>TBC</em> predates <em>ANJ v ANK</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> in which the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court. The lower court in <em>ANJ</em> had ordered the parties to pay the children’s expenses along similar proportions with their respective incomes. Additionally, I would highlight the High Court case of <em>TIT v TIU</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span> which distinguishes the case of <em>TBC</em>. Of key importance is the Honourable Judge’s pronouncement in [63]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“The prevailing standard of s68 (and s69) of the Charter must be </em> <em><u>the </u></em> <em>reasonableness </em> <em><u>having regard to all the circumstances of the case</u></em> <em>, and the best interests of the children. In accordance with the Court of Appeals’ approach in ANJ v ANK, the financial capabilities of the parents must be a valid consideration. In this context, both the parties in TBC v TBD … </em> <em><u>were well able to afford </u></em> <em>the orders for equal contribution.” [emphasis mine]</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     In other words, there is no default position whereby both parties are to bear the financial burden equally. In this regard, I would respectfully disagree with the PH’s reliance on the case of <em>TBC</em> which mentions in [27].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“Each parent stands in the same parent-child relationship with the child or children and each parent has the duty to maintain the child or children. Against that backdrop, the starting point should be that the parents bear the financial burden equally.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     Instead, I am guided by the principle that “equality in responsibility does not necessarily suggest equality in financial contribution regardless of each parent’s financial means”, which was endorsed in the case of <em>TIT</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span>. It follows therefore that each case will turn on the facts and all factors relevant to the determination of the parties’ financial means must be considered without any factor being given predominant weight.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     Returning to the present case, the PH has not explained why the parties’ financial capabilities would support his position of equal contribution. As mentioned above, based on the PH’s income in regular years, the PH earns about 20% more than the DW. Once every 4 years when the turnaround event happens, the PH’s income increases by 10%<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> over and above the usual increment he receives. Although the DW will receive about $200,000 more than the PH after the division of assets, the DW will have to find suitable accommodations for herself and the 2 children within reasonable distance from their school. The children will also spend most of their time with the DW. In contrast, while the PH will similarly require a place to live, his choice of accommodation is not constrained by the distance nor the size. Given these reasons, it is reasonable to assume that the DW’s financial burden will be heavier than that of the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     Additionally, both children’s monthly expenses are in the region of $3,000 (excluding expenses to be paid on a reimbursement basis) and represents a significant portion of the DW’s income which is just under $5,200. The facts of this case differs from the case of <em>TBC</em> in which the Court held that the mother could afford to bear 50% of the child’s expenses, ie. $720 out of her income of $5,200. As I have found DW’s reasonable expenses to be around $2,200, I accept that the DW will not have the financial means to contribute equally to the children’s total reasonable expenses. The PH has also not provided reasons otherwise. It is not his position that he is unable to afford his share of the children’s expenses. In any event, based on his income and reasonable monthly expenses (ascertained to be around $3,400 in <u>Annex 1</u>), I believe he has the means to pay his share of the children’s reasonable expenses, as determined by the parties’ income ratio. I am further of the view that the PH should look to reduce his car expenses which constitutes 70% of his monthly expenses. Accordingly, I order PH to bear 55% of the children’s reasonable expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Children’s reasonable expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     After reviewing the evidence, I determine the 1<sup>st</sup> child’s reasonable expenses to be $1,464 and the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s expenses to be $1,434. Both figures exclude certain expenses which are to be paid on a reimbursement basis according to the parties’ respective contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     As mentioned above, the PH is to bear 55% of the children’s reasonable expenses. Accordingly, excluding the expenses which are to be reimbursed, the PH is to pay monthly maintenance of $805 for the 1<sup>st</sup> child and $790 for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     Tables 8 and 9 below set out the parties’ positions and my findings on the children’s expenses.

id=\"\"></a> <u>Groceries / Food</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     The DW’s claim of $600 per month for each child’s groceries and food expenses is on the high side. I accept the PH’s figure of $400 per child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Enrichment expense for the 1st child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     I allowed a sum of $400 per month for the 1<sup>st</sup> child’s enrichment and tuition expenses. The DW has submitted evidence to show that the 1<sup>st</sup> child takes swimming lessons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_127\" id=\"Ftn_127_1\"><sup>[note: 127]</sup></a></span> which averages around $100 per month and skating lessons<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_128\" id=\"Ftn_128_1\"><sup>[note: 128]</sup></a></span> which costs $70 per lesson weekly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     The PH disagrees that he should pay for the child’s enrichment expense as his prior consent was not sought. The DW contends that she had always planned the children’s enrichment classes and the PH had never been involved. I disagree that the PH’s consent is necessary given that he has admitted that he left the DW to take care of the children’s “education matters and their learning progress”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_129\" id=\"Ftn_129_1\"><sup>[note: 129]</sup></a></span> which, in my view, encompasses related matters such as enrichment classes. The 1<sup>st</sup> child is presently 8 years old and it is not unreasonable for the child to have some form of enrichment. The PH is to bear 55% of the enrichment fees on a reimbursement basis subject to a cap of $400. The cap is based on the child’s historical expenses and can be incurred without the PH’s prior consent. The PH’s prior consent will be required only if the monthly enrichment fees exceed the cap of $400 provided the PH is expected to contribute towards the additional expense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Enrichment expense for the 2nd child</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The DW claims a sum of $150 as enrichment expenses for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child.

However, there is insufficient evidence on the precise premiums payable for policies which do not have an investment component. I have ordered the PH to bear 55% of the insurance premiums on a reimbursement basis up to the DW’s claimed amount of $115.33.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Entertainment and holiday expenses</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     The PH submits that this expense should not form part of the DW’s claim and each party should pay for the children’s expenses respectively. On the PH’s part, he claims that he spends a total of $200<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_131\" id=\"Ftn_131_1\"><sup>[note: 131]</sup></a></span> per month on the children for their entertainment although it is undisputed that he only has ad hoc access to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    I allow a sum of $100 per child for the combined item of entertainment and holiday expenses. There is evidence to show that outings are part of the children’s common routine<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_132\" id=\"Ftn_132_1\"><sup>[note: 132]</sup></a></span>. Additionally, the DW has also brought the children on short overseas trips in the past<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_133\" id=\"Ftn_133_1\"><sup>[note: 133]</sup></a></span>. This amount is reasonable given that the children spend the majority of their time with the DW.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>DW’s request for children maintenance to be paid in a lump sum from the PH’s share of the sale proceeds</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    I have not allowed the DW’s claim for the children’s maintenance to be paid in a lump sum. The DW’s reasons for lump sum maintenance are that (a) the PH is likely to default in the payment of maintenance (b) the DW will have to incur legal costs to enforce the maintenance arrears (c) the upfront lump sum maintenance will allow the DW to retain the flat to provide the children with a stable environment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    First, there is no evidence that the PH is likely to default on the maintenance payments. There has been no court order for maintenance. The DW had also not taken out any application for maintenance. Additionally, it is undisputed that the PH did contribute towards the joint account in the past before and after the marriage broke down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    The DW also contends that the PH is financially irresponsible as he has credit card debts. However, the relevant question is whether the PH is likely to default on the maintenance payments rather than the PH’s management of his finances. In the present case, the PH’s credit card debts of over $5,000 is not considered excessive to the extent that the PH will be incapable of fulfilling his financial obligations. Therefore, I do not accept that the PH is likely to default on his maintenance obligations. I am also not persuaded by the DW’s further argument that she should not have to incur legal costs to pursue enforcement actions. If enforcement action is necessary in future, the DW can claim costs if she is successful in the enforcement action. The possibility that legal costs may be incurred in future enforcement proceedings, which may or may not be necessary, cannot be the basis upon which the court will order maintenance to be paid in a lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    I next turn to the DW’s submission that the lump sum payment will allow her to retain the flat which will be in the best interests of the children. I accept that, in all likelihood, the DW will not be able to buy over the PH’s share in the flat given the present value of the property and her income. However, those reasons alone are not sufficient for the Court to order the PH to pay maintenance in a lump sum. It is trite law that the Court must, in awarding lump sum maintenance, consider the paying party’s financial resources and ability to pay maintenance in a lump sum. In the present case, the PH does not have significant savings of his own. The bulk of his assets will come from his CPF monies and the cash proceeds from the sale. With these monies, the PH will similarly have to find his own accommodations. I am of the view that PH will not have the ability and resources to pay all future maintenance in a lump sum and such an order will cripple the PH financially.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    I touch briefly on the DW’s additional submission that retaining the current matrimonial flat is in the children’s interests, which would justify her claim for lump sum maintenance. The DW explained that uprooting the children from the present living environment will disrupt their living and schooling arrangements. I accept that, in all likelihood, the children will have a longer commute to and from school. It also goes without saying that the children will have to adapt to a new living environment. Nonetheless, any impact to the children can be mitigated by the constant presence of the primary caregiver. Accordingly, I am of the view that retaining a flat which the DW will struggle to finance, may not necessarily be in the children’s best interests. For the above reasons, I dismissed the DW’s prayer for the children maintenance to be paid in a lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders on maintenance for wife and children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    In conclusion, the orders for maintenance are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_A\"></a>A.     There shall be no maintenance for the Defendant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B\"></a>B.     The Father shall pay maintenance for the children as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B-p3_i\"></a>i.       Monthly maintenance in the sum of $850 for the 1<sup>st</sup> child and $790 for the 2<sup>nd</sup> child, which shall commence on 5 May 2025, and subsequently on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of each month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_B-p3_ii\"></a>ii.       55% of the following expenses on a reimbursement basis : (i) school fees for both children (ii) enrichment fees for the 1<sup>st</sup> child capped at $400 per month (iii) insurance premiums capped $115.33 per month per child for both children. The PH shall make payment of the expenses within 14 days from the date on which the DW provides the invoices to the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_106-p2_C\"></a>C.     All maintenance payments are to be made to xx bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Children orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    The parties agree that there shall be joint custody of both children, with care and control to the DW. The parties however disagree on the PH’s access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Father’s access </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    The PH seeks regular overnight and unsupervised access to the children. The PH points out that he has a close relationship with the children. He alleges that the DW has restricted his access to the children since the breakdown in the marriage. Although there was an informal access arrangement in place after the PH moved out of the matrimonial home in which he gave prior notice to the DW to exercise access, the informal arrangement did not work well as the DW has, at times, deprived him of access or demanded that his access be supervised. In one instance, the DW turned aggressive as captured in a video footage submitted by the PH.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    On the other hand, the DW contends that she is “open to a progressive access regime beginning with supervised sessions and, subject to positive outcomes and demonstrated parental responsibility, leading to increased flexibility.” She proposes that there should be a review at “an appropriate milestone”, either determined by the children’s ages or as recommended by a family specialist<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_134\" id=\"Ftn_134_1\"><sup>[note: 134]</sup></a></span>. The DW submits that supervised access is in the best interests of the children<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_135\" id=\"Ftn_135_1\"><sup>[note: 135]</sup></a></span> for various reasons. First, the children are young and unable to express their independent preferences on access. Second, the PH has persistently failed to give adequate notice of his intention to exercise access. Third, the PH has not shown that he is capable of prioritising the children’s needs. Fourth, the PH may introduce his romantic partners to the children which would confuse the children. In response to the PH’s video footage, she explains that she had intervened when she noticed the 2<sup>nd</sup> child’s distress and accuses the PH of displaying confrontational behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    At the onset, it is necessary to reiterate that the Court must focus on the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration in the making of any child-related orders pursuant to section 125 of the Women’s Charter. It is also widely accepted that, save for exceptional circumstances, the best interest of a child is best served by ensuring the continuing involvement of both parents in the child’s life. In respect of the types of access orders which will promote a child’s welfare, the High Court case of <em>APE v APF</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_136\" id=\"Ftn_136_1\"><sup>[note: 136]</sup></a></span> in [32] makes clear that unsupervised access should be awarded unless there are exceptional circumstances present. The Honourable Judge in <em>APE</em> mentioned three exceptional circumstances which may warrant supervised access, first where there are serious welfare concerns due to violence or inappropriate parenting, second where the parent-child relationship is estranged to the extent where serious repair is required, third where the parents’ relationship is acrimonious to the extent that the unsupervised access cannot be effectively implemented. The same principles are endorsed in the later High Court case of <em>WZF v WZG</em><span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_137\" id=\"Ftn_137_1\"><sup>[note: 137]</sup></a></span> and is in line with the pronouncement in <em>WQT v WQU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30967-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 3</a> in which the Honourable Judge commented in [5]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“Supervised access is a necessity and not an order to be made as a precaution when there are no indications that it is needed.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>None of DW’s reasons for seeking supervised access satisfy the criteria of exceptional circumstances mentioned in <em>APE</em>. The DW claims that the children are young and unsupervised access is unsuitable. The young age of a child does not immediately preclude the access parent from having unsupervised access. The key point is the child’s inability to communicate and the access parent’s unfamiliarity with the child, rather than the child’s young age per se. In the present case, neither of the children who are 5 and 8 respectively are considered too young to vocalise their needs as and when required. At the same time, it is not the case that the Father has been consistently absent from their lives and he would need time to resume his relationship with the children. Instead, the DW’s contention seems to be that the children should be allowed to decide if, how and when they wish to spend time with their father, and the children are too young to indicate their preference. In my view, this is not the reason to order supervised access. Although the Father has had somewhat irregular access since the marriage broke down, the children are not unfamiliar with him to the extent that the Father and children require therapeutic interventions to resume contact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    As for the DW’s claim that the Father has not proven himself to be a parent who prioritises the children’s needs, I find this contention to be lacking in concrete examples and evidence. It is unclear how the Father has failed to prioritise the children’s needs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    I do, however, accept the DW’s contention that the PH does not give sufficient notice of his intention to exercise access, and cancels or change agreed plans at short notice<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_138\" id=\"Ftn_138_1\"><sup>[note: 138]</sup></a></span>, although this seems to be primarily due to the nature of his shift work. Even if this is the case, the solution is to put in place structured access orders and to impose a minimum notice period when there are changes to the access arrangements, rather than to supervise his access. It is unclear how an order for supervised access will cure the disruption to the children’s daily arrangements arising from last-minute changes. It is also bewildering why the DW prayed for access to remain flexible despite the challenges posed from the same arrangement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    As for the DW’s concern that the PH will bring his romantic partners to access, I am of the view that this fear alone will not justify making an order for supervised access unless there is a real possibility that the PH has regularly exhibited clear disregard of court orders. In fact, there is no evidence that the PH has brought a third party to meet the children during his access although his access has been unsupervised since the breakdown in the marriage. For the above reasons, I agree with the PH that his access to the children should be unsupervised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    As mentioned above, the PH also prays for overnight access to the children from Friday to Saturday if his off-days fall on those days. Additionally, the PH requests that he has access for half of the school holidays and the Chinese New Year public holiday<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_139\" id=\"Ftn_139_1\"><sup>[note: 139]</sup></a></span>. The DW’s position is that there should be no overnight access unless the PH is supervised by his sister and access is in a hotel. The DW’s reasons are that the PH is currently living with his aunt and occupies a small bedroom. There is insufficient space for the children to sleep comfortably. The DW further submits that PH’s overnight access should be supervised as both children are daughters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    Save for the DW’s concerns regarding the PH’s present living arrangements, I find the DW’s reasons for refusing overnight access to be unjustified. The DW seems to suggest that it is inappropriate for the DW to spend the night alone with the children. However, the DW gives no reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    Nonetheless I am of the view that overnight access is not in the children’s best interests at this stage for different reasons. First, from the evidence<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_140\" id=\"Ftn_140_1\"><sup>[note: 140]</sup></a></span>, the PH’s shift work is likely to pose practical challenges in the making of fixed access arrangements. The PH’s roster works in this way. He has the same off-days on weeks 1 and 3 but does different shifts, ie. night shift in week 1 and day shift in week 3. The same principle applies for weeks 2 and 4. In other words, within a single month, his work schedule differs from week to week and is only repeated every 4 weeks. These changes, although predictable, will pose practical challenges in access arrangements. In short, any structured access arrangement must be planned on a 4-week cycle. From the perspective of the children, the arrangements will change from week to week, which can be admittedly confusing and disorientating particularly for the 1<sup>st</sup> child who also has regular enrichment classes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    In addition, the PH’s schedule may be subject to change at short notice as he may be activated to cover absent colleagues who are on sick leave<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_141\" id=\"Ftn_141_1\"><sup>[note: 141]</sup></a></span>. While the PH’s work commitments may be the reason for the last-minute changes, it does not detract from the fact that this makes access arrangements particularly unpredictable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    Given the above challenges and bearing in mind that the parties have never worked with a structured access arrangement, I am of the view that it is premature to grant overnight access at this stage. The workability of a structured day access arrangement remains untested. Overnight access arrangements require more planning and coordination ahead of the access and will likely be more disruptive when the access is cancelled or changed at short notice. As for the PH’s request for half of the school holidays and Chinese New Year, the PH has not explained if he is able to take leave for an extended period or specifically during the Chinese New Year holidays.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    Additionally, I agree with the DW that the PH’s present living conditions is not conducive and suitable for both children to have overnight access. The PH occupies a room at his aunt’s house and there does not seem to be sufficient space for the children to be sleeping with the P in the same room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    For these reasons, I am of the view that it is premature for the PH to have overnight access. Given the nature of his job, it is important that the PH first establishes a routine access arrangement with minimal last-minute changes. This will reduce the disruption to the children’s arrangements and build confidence and trust between the parties in their co-parenting journey. The parties are free to agree on overnight access if the opportunity arises. It is also for the same reasons that I dismiss the Father’s prayer for overseas access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    In conclusion, I allow the PH’s prayer for unsupervised access but limited to daytime access. The access arrangement is tailored for the PH’s work schedule. To minimise the disruption to the children’s routine, I have included a fairly prescriptive notice framework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Orders for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    The orders for the children are as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_1\"></a>(1)     By consent, the parties shall have joint custody of the children of the marriage, with care and control to the Mother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2\"></a>(2)     The Father shall have unsupervised access to both children as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Regular access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_a\"></a>a)       Weeks 1 and 3: every Tuesday from 430pm to 800pm, every Saturday from 930am to 800pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_b\"></a>b)       Weeks 2 and 4: every Thursday from 430pm to 800pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>School holiday and public holiday access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_c\"></a>c)       Access days are to follow regular access, save that the weekday access is to take place from 930am to 800pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Special day and birthday access</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_d\"></a>d)       The Father shall have access on Father’s Day and his birthday by giving 1-week advanced written notice indicating his intention to exercise access, in which event the Father’s access will follow either holiday access (if it is a non-school day) OR regular access (if it is a school day).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_e\"></a>e)       Father shall not have access to the children on Mother’s Day and Mother’s birthday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_122-p2_2-p3_f\"></a>f)       The Father will have access to the children on their birthdays if their birthdays fall on his access days in accordance with either clauses (a), (b) or (c).

class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This case raises two significant issues of public and procedural interest. <em>First</em>, can a person publish on his/her social media platform information and materials relating to ongoing proceedings in the Family Justice Courts? <em>Second</em>, can the person be required to remove such information and materials if they were published <em>before</em> the commencement of the proceedings?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Applicant (“<b>Mother</b>”) and Respondent (“<b>Father</b>”) are former spouses. They have two children – a son (born in September 2011) and a daughter (born in October 2014). The marriage was dissolved in 2020.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Allegations of sexual abuse</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In 2019, the Father was reported to the authorities for allegedly sexually abusing his daughter on two occasions. Police investigated into the matter. He denied the allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Thereafter, the Father posted various messages on Facebook referencing the allegations, including – “Allegations in April 2019 and October 2019”, “CPS had suspended all contact in October 2019”, and “AGC decision still pending???”.

There are several reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Confidentiality of family proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15      <em>First</em>, family proceedings deal with intensely personal matters. Public disclosures risk inflaming conflict, aggravating trauma, and derailing therapeutic processes: <em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/29479-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 5 SLR 896</a> (“<b><em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em></b>”) at [20]. This is why Parliament enacted s 10(1) of the Family Justice Act 2014 (“<b>FJA</b>”), which requires family proceedings to be held in private unless the court orders otherwise.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The confidentiality extends beyond the life of the proceeding. It has been held that court documents – including affidavits – retain their confidential status and can be protected from disclosure after the family proceeding is over: <em>SRS Life Sciences Pte Ltd and others v Rastogi Mahika Suchet</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30766-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGDC 278</a> at [22] to [25], citing <em>Jethanand Harkishindas Bhojwani v Lakshmi Prataprai Bhojwani</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27673-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1211</a> at [96].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Protection of children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17      <em>Second</em>, confidentiality is of particular importance where a “child” or “young person” is the alleged victim in, or the basis for, a proceeding:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span><em>GCP v GCS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24537-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGDC 122</a> at [25]. Section 112(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act (“<b>CYPA</b>”) prohibits a person from doing any of the following unless ordered by the court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>a</em>)    publish or broadcast any information relating to any proceedings in any court or on appeal from any court that reveals the name, address or school or that includes any particulars that are calculated to lead to the identification of any child or young person concerned in the proceedings, either as being the person against or in respect of whom the proceedings are taken or as being a witness therein;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    publish or broadcast any picture as being or including a picture of any child or young person so concerned in any such proceedings;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Integrity of judicial process</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18      <em>Third</em>, s 3(1)(b) and s 3(1)(e) of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (“<b>AJPA</b>”) prohibits publications and any other acts that pose a real risk of prejudice or interference with pending proceedings. Importantly, liability may attach under s 3(1)(b) even if the person did not intend to cause prejudice or interference: s 3(3) of the AJPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The breadth of these provisions serves to underscore the importance that the law gives to safeguarding the integrity of the judicial process. This is not surprising. Publication of information and materials on social media about an ongoing proceeding can, directly or indirectly, exert undue influence on litigants, their witnesses, the courts. Such publication can also sway public opinion regarding the merits of the evidence and judicial decision in the proceeding – thus undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Gag orders as protective tools</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Given the above, a person must provide a good explanation as to why it is necessary for him/her to publish on social media information and materials relating to ongoing family proceedings. This burden is especially onerous when the information, material, or proceedings concern a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     If the person fails to provide a good explanation, then he/she may also be potentially liable for contempt of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In addition, the person may also be subject to a gag order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Where the publication involves a witness to the family proceeding, s 10(4) of the FJA provides that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A Family Justice Court may at any time order that no person is to –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    publish the name, address or photograph of any witness in any matter or proceeding or any part thereof tried or held or to be tried or held before it, or any evidence or any other thing likely to lead to the identification of any such witness;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    do any other act which is likely to lead to the identification of any witness mentioned in paragraph (a);</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Separately, courts retain inherent powers to issue gag orders to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of their judicial process, as well as to protect children’s interests: <em>Re Tay Quan Li Leon</em> at [19], [20] [23] to [25].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Courts are not limited to issuing gag orders only after information and materials relating to ongoing family proceedings have been published on social media. The law would be ineffective if courts can only act where the relevant interests have already been compromised. Court can take <em>pre-emptive</em> measures to protect. This is evident, for instance, from the wide language in s 10(4)(a) of the FJA which allows courts to issue a gag order in relation to “any witness in any matter or proceeding ... <em>to be tried</em> ... before it”: see [23] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Along the same principle, I see no good reason why gag orders cannot be issued against information and materials published on social media <em>before</em> the commencement of a family proceeding – if this is necessary to prevent the confidentiality and integrity of family proceedings, and the children’s interests, from being endangered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Key issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I shall now apply the above considerations to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father did not dispute that he had published the Relevant Publications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Accordingly, the key issues to be determined as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Whether the Relevant Publications can undermine the confidentiality of the proceedings in SSP 442 (“<b>Proceeding</b>”)?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Whether they harm the daughter’s interests by revealing her identity and connecting her to the sexual abuse allegations?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_29-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Whether they pose a risk of prejudicing or interfering with the Proceeding?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Confidentiality of the Proceeding</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In my view, the Relevant Publications can undermine the confidentiality of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Relevant Publications make direct reference to the sexual abuse allegations forming the subject matter of SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     They also disclose factual details likely to be aired at trial. These included the daughter’s medical reports which provided information on, among others, (i) the injury allegedly found on the daughter’s private parts, (ii) the date/time/location of the alleged sexual abuse, (iii) the daughter’s account regarding how they had occurred, and (iv) accounts by the Mother and other persons regarding how the alleged abuse came to light. Such information will be relevant in the trial of SSP 442. The trial will commence in about a week’s time (from 13 August 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     The Father contended that all the publications pre-dated the commencement of SSP 442.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     This is factually inaccurate. At least one YouTube video was posted on 26 March 2025, after the filing of SSP 442. This video contained images of (a) the summons for SSP 442<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> and (b) a letter from the Police informing the Father that no further action would be taken against him:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> see [5] above. These clearly disclose the existence of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The fact that the remaining publications pre-dated SSP 442 does not immunise them from a gag order. As explained above, the court may impose gag orders where a publication risks undermining the confidentiality or integrity of an ongoing proceeding. The timing of publication is not determinative. A contrary view will (i) lead to an artificial distinction being drawn between the publications when they contain very similar contents, and (ii) importantly, fail to adequately safeguard the confidentiality of the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     In my view, the concerns in [30] above (in and of themselves) provide sufficient basis to issue a gag order in this case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Harm to the daughter’s interests </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I now turn to the next issue – i.e., whether the Relevant Publications reveal the daughter’s identity and connect her to the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     In my view, the answer is yes. The daughter is the subject and a witness in SSP 442. As such, her identity must be protected under s 112(1) of the CYPA and s 10(4) of the FJA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Father contended that it is unnecessary to remove the Relevant Publications from his social media platforms because they would not disclose the daughter’s identity. He gave three reasons for taking this view. <em>First</em>, he had redacted her name from the publications. (This shows that the Father had recognised that it is against the daughter’s interest for her name to be connected to the relevant materials.) <em>Second</em>, the publications do not contain any recent photo of the daughter’s face – the latest photo was taken some six years ago (in 2019).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span><em>Third</em>, and in any event, his social media accounts did not have many followers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     I am unable to agree with the Father. Despite his redactions, persons who view the Relevant Publications can easily piece together from the following information and materials to uncover the daughter’s identity and connect her to the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Relevant Publications were published on the Father’s social media platforms. His name, personal details, and photos with the daughter appear in the profile pages of these platforms.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s <em>full name</em> appears unredacted in several of the published medical reports of the daughter.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> In the YouTube posts, a photo of the Father carrying daughter is superimposed on these reports.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The YouTube video published on 26 March 2025 (see [32] above) showed the summons for SSP 442. The summons contained the Father’s full name and his address as the location where the family violence was allegedly committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     These disclosures create a real risk of exposing the daughter to stigma and distress. Removal of the publications is therefore necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Risk of prejudice or interference</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Finally, I find that it is also necessary to remove the Relevant Publications because they can potentially prejudice and interfere with the Proceeding. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father’s posts are public and plainly intended to solicit sympathy and portray the sexual abuse allegations as false. He used emotionally charged language and selectively disclosed materials – e.g., a letter from the Police informing him that no further action will be taken against him (“<b>Letter</b>”) and extracts from affidavits – to show that he had been absolved of these allegations and to support his narrative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the 26 March 2025, the Father had published on YouTube the summons for SSP 442 and the Letter. The dates of these two documents were highlighted. His intention of doing so, when seen in the light of the other Relevant Publications, is clear – to convey to the viewers that the Proceeding is without merit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     During the hearing, the Father informed that the Relevant Publications on his YouTube account were still accessible by the public as at the date of the gag order hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Given the above, if the Relevant Publications continue to be accessible by the public while the Proceeding is ongoing, this can heighten the risk of viewers associating them with the Proceeding.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     Furthermore, the Father’s conduct suggests that he may publish more information and materials regarding the sexual abuse allegations – this time in connection with the Proceeding. I say this because of the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father has no qualms about turning to social media to discredit the Mother (the person who had filed SSP 442) and to prove his innocence regarding the sexual abuse allegations. He had repeatedly posted such content despite account suspensions and solicitor warnings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Furthermore, the Father appeared unapologetic at the hearing and sought to justify his conduct. He had insisted that it was reasonable for him to post the Relevant Publications – claiming that he had made them accessible to the public to reach out to his lost contacts. The Father contended that he would not have done so if the Mother did not cause his social media accounts to be suspended.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father had either failed to appreciate – or wilfully ignored – the harm that his publications can harm the daughter’s interests. Even if his intention of making his publications accessible to the public was to reach out to his lost contacts, there is no need for him to publish intimate details, court documents, and the daughter’s medical reports regarding the sexual abuse allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     If left unrestrained, the Father may continue publishing information and materials that can undermine the fairness and impartiality of the upcoming trial. Such conduct can interfere with the proceeding in at least two ways: <em>first</em>, by exerting emotional pressure on the Mother and daughter; and <em>second</em>, by shaping the perception of persons (who view his social media) regarding the merits of SSP 442. The Father’s persistence in posting the Relevant Publications – despite multiple suspensions and solicitor’s warnings – reinforces the need for judicial intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I therefore ordered that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father shall remove, and is prohibited from publishing, any content on his social media platforms that is likely to identify the daughter in connection with SSP 442. The Father shall comply with the removal order no later than 6 August 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father shall not engage in any conduct prohibited under s 3(1) AJPA, including publishing material that poses a real risk of prejudicing or interfering with SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     During the hearing, I issued the following caution to the Father:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">You must refrain from conducting a “trial by public opinion” to vindicate your position or express dissatisfaction with ongoing legal proceedings. The appropriate – and only – forum for resolving legal disputes is the court of law. Persisting in such conduct risks contempt of court, and more importantly, inflicting harm on your daughter’s well-being. The Court will not tolerate such conduct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     For clarity, I make the following observations:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I reiterate that the orders I have made are not punitive but protective in nature. They are necessary to safeguard the interests of the parties in SSP 442, the daughter, and the judicial process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in making my orders, I have carefully considered the need to balance the Father’s wish to share information about his life on social media against the overriding need to protect his daughter’s interests and to safeguard the integrity of judicial process. My orders do not preclude him from sharing photos of happy moments with his daughter. What he must refrain from doing is to associate such content with SSP 442.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, I express no views on the merits of the substantive allegations in SSP 442. My orders pertain solely to procedural and protective considerations. They should not be construed as pre-judging the outcome of the substantive hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Fourth</em>, I note that the Mother had previously obtained a personal protection order (PPO XXX/2020) against the Father in March 2020. She has alleged that he continues to disregard this order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> I make no findings on this issue and will leave it to her to pursue the appropriate remedies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     For completeness, I wish to address one other point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father contended that he had been disadvantaged in presenting his case at the gag order hearing by (i) the shortness of time to prepare for the hearing and (ii) a lack of legal representation at the hearing. According to him, if legal aid was granted, his lawyer would need six to eight weeks to be ready to represent him for the gag order application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     I am unable to agree that the Father had been disadvantaged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, the Mother’s solicitors had given him ample notice before commencing action the gag order application: see [10] and [11] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, the facts in this case are straightforward and not in dispute – i.e., the Father admitted that he had posted the Relevant Publications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)        <em>Third</em>, this case did not involve any complex issues of law. The relevant law had been set out in the Mother’s affidavit dated 22 July 2025 at [30]. The key issue at the gag order hearing is simply this – Should the Father be ordered to remove the Relevant Publications and not to post further publications regarding the sexual abuse allegations and the Proceeding. The considerations for resolving this issue are straightforward – i.e., Is a gag order needed to protect the confidentiality of the Proceeding and the daughter’s interests, as well as to safeguard the integrity of judicial process. The application of these considerations to the present case is straightforward.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       During the gag order hearing, the Father had no difficulty presenting his case. His affidavit is clear and shows that he understands the law. For instance, he cited the “hearsay” rule (correctly) to challenge certain aspects of the Mother’s affidavit as being “inadmissible”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> He had also sought an “order for costs on an indemnity basis” in his affidavit.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Additionally, the Father succeeded in persuading me that an email which he had sent on 18 March 2025 to the Minister of State for Law, Attorney-General’s Chambers and the Family Justice Courts should not be subject to a gag order.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)        <em>Finally</em>, the Father’s position that the gag order hearing should only take place in six to eight weeks’ time is clearly untenable. The Proceeding is due to commence in a matter of days. Where concerns have been raised in connection with an imminent trial, they should be resolved expeditiously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I now come to the issue of costs. I am mindful that the Father is receiving legal aid for the conduct of another family proceeding involving the Mother. This did not entitle him to disregard reasonable requests to remove sensitive content. His failure to engage constructively led to unnecessary litigation: see [10] and [11] above. After considering the extent of work involved in preparing for this gag order hearing, I ordered costs at <b>$6,000</b> (all in) against the Father on an indemnity basis.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>This is the second time the parties were divorced.

Thereunder, the children would be placed in the care of their mother under the supervision of an approved welfare officer. Further, the children and their mother were to reside at a crisis shelter or the residence of a safe adult. The children and their mother were in favour of the application. The father of the children objected to the application. I granted the CPOs and most of the incidental orders that the Child Protector had sought.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The father is dissatisfied with these decisions and has filed an appeal against them. I now provide the reasons for these decisions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The parents married in 2007. The children were respectively 16 and 10 years of age. The family had resided in China up until 2020, when they emigrated to Singapore. The mother remains a citizen of China. The father and the children are citizens of Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The marriage was tempestuous. Barely four years into it, conflicts and violence were occurring between the parents “once or twice a month”. By October 2024, the frequency of these conflicts had increased to “once or twice a week”. Worse, these conflicts had grown in severity with chairs thrown around the matrimonial home and the parents brawling with slippers. Occasionally, the elder child would intervene in the scuffles to attempt to restrain the father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The events came to a head in March 2025, when the mother left the matrimonial home and sought refuge at a crisis shelter. The father continued to reside in the matrimonial home with the children. The Child Protector was concerned about the safety of the children there, exercised its powers under s 11 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”) to commit them to the Interim Placement and Assessment Centre – Salvation Army Gracehaven pending its application for CPOs in respect of them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The mother subsequently found rental accommodation with a landlord who had been a tenant at the matrimonial home but who had since procured her own apartment. The Child Protector corresponded with the landlord and assessed that she was a “safe adult” whose apartment would provide safe refuge to the children. Pending the determination of the CPOs, the Child Protector applied to the Youth Court for interim orders to return the children to the care of the mother, albeit under the supervision of an approved welfare officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 2 May 2025, the Youth Court granted these interim orders and directed that the children were to reside with the mother at the crisis shelter or at the residence of a safe adult as assessed and approved by the Child Protector. The Youth Court added that the father was to abstain from visiting the crisis shelter and the schools and tuition centres that the children attended without the approval of the Approved Welfare Officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       On 19 May 2025, the father appeared outside the gate of the school that the younger child was attending. He was seen by the Approved Welfare Officer, who deposed to this sighting in these proceedings. The Approved Welfare Officer deposed further that no approval had been granted to the father to so attend at the gate of the school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       On 21 May 2025, the father appeared near the apartment of the safe adult. He spotted the mother at a carpark and confronted her about an application for a Personal Protection Order that she had filed against him. The mother reported this incident to the Child Protector the same day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     On 22 May 2025, the father appeared once again near the apartment of the safe adult. He spotted the younger child and followed the younger child to the apartment. He entered the apartment and confronted the mother, who told the children to leave before speaking with the father. The father subsequently left but returned to the apartment on two further occasions that same day and demanded to speak with the mother each time. The mother reported these incidents to the police and to the Child Protector.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     On 23 May 2025, the father appeared at the workplace of the mother and demanded to speak wit her. The mother called the police. When the police arrived, the father left.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Before me, the Child Protector sought CPOs to place the children in the care of their mother under the supervision of an approved welfare officer for 12 months. It argued that the children were in need of care and protection within the CYPA on two grounds. First, that they were at risk of ill-treatment by their father because of violence that he had perpetrated on the elder child and on their mother. Second, that they were likely to suffer emotional harm because of emotional or psychological abuse to which they had been subject by their father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The mother and the children agreed. The mother added that she would be happy to return to the matrimonial home with the children if the father moved out of the matrimonial home. The elder child desired to return to the matrimonial home under the care of the mother but not the father because of his strained relationship with the latter. The younger child desired to return to the matrimonial home under the care of both the parents and wished that they put their conflict behind them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The father disagreed and submitted that the children should return to living with him in the matrimonial home. He did not deny the broad narratives of the Child Protector, or the general acrimony between him and the mother. He shared a willingness to reside away from the family for “a month” but believed that separation for longer periods would further strain their relationship and was “not good for family development”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I agreed with the Child Protector that the children were in need of the care and protection of the State at least because they had suffered or were likely to suffer from emotional harm on account of emotional or psychological abuse by their parents within s 5(1)(g) of the CYPA. The notion of such “emotional or psychological abuse” by a parent was broad. As set out in s 5(2)(f) of the CYPA, it extended to exposing a child to or placing a child at risk of exposure to “violence against a related person of the child”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     When the family resided together, the enmity between the parents produced conflict and violence. The triggers of such conflict and violence were many and included disagreements between the parents over the education of the children, the travel habits of the mother, and the unemployment of the father. These disagreements, in turn, appeared to stem from a divergence between the parents in their philosophies on marriage: the father viewed the mother as a homemaker who was to “abide by his instructions as he is the head of the household”. The mother expected that both parents share in the breadwinning and the homemaking.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Child Protector described the father as an individual with “deep-rooted cultural beliefs that shapes his behaviour and expectations towards [the mother]”. It added that the father exerted “coercive control” over the mother by expecting her to “retur[n] home immediately after work by 7pm and prepar[e] dinner for the family” and “complete household chores and be responsible for the children’s academics to his standard”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Whether or not the expectations of the father were “coercive” of the mother, it sufficed for these proceedings that the philosophical divergence between them had escalated into frequent conflicts and violence in the presence of the children. Even after the intervention of the Child Protector in the family and the ensuing relocation of the mother, the parental conflict persisted with the father confronting the mother at her new residence in the presence of the children. Further, the parental conflict had affected the children adversely with the elder child sharing a strained relationship with the father and the younger child experiencing feelings of worry and fear during the incidents of conflict. It was thus evident that, without more, the children were at risk of emotional harm because of emotional or psychological abuse on account of the parental conflict that exposed them to violence between their parents. Further, it would be in the welfare and best interests of the children to place them on CPOs, under the care and protection of the State, while allied professionals engaged the parents on resolving their parental conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     As for the specific CPOs to be made, I agreed with the Child Protector that it would be in the welfare of the children to place them in the care of their mother, with whom they both shared a functional relationship, for 12 months. The mother had been a caregiver for the children even as she travelled for work. Despite her relocation to the apartment of a safe adult, that environment remained suitable for the children because they had known the safe adult from their childhood when the safe adult was a tenant at the matrimonial home. Further, the mother would enjoy the support and supervision of an approved welfare officer in her care for the children under during these 12 months. The time would also provide the children with space, particularly from the father, to heal and mend their relationships with both of their parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     To address the philosophical differences that underlay the parental conflicts and violence, I directed the family to attend such mediation, counselling, psychotherapy, assessments, programmes, and treatments as deemed necessary by the approved welfare officer. I also directed that the relevant professionals release medical, psychological, counselling, and relevant reports of the family to the approved welfare officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Meanwhile, to fortify the safety of the children, I ordered the parents to abstain from acts that will compromise the safety and well-being of the children as well as to participate in interviews and discuss and comply with the safety plans and caregiving arrangements agreed upon, with the approved welfare officer. Further, as sought by the Child Protector, the approved welfare officer was to approve and review the contacts of the father and his significant others with the children, and the father was to abstain from going to or near the apartment of the safe adult and the schools and tuition centres of the children.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Personal Protection Order"],"date":"2025-08-06","court":"Family Court","case-number":"SS 1278 of 2024","title":"XQB v XQC","citation":"[2025] SGFC 82","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33639-SSP.xml","counsel":["Lim May Li (Lim & Ong) for the Applicant","Michael Moey Chin Woon (Moey & Yuen) for the Respondent."],"timestamp":"2025-08-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XQB v XQC</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XQB <em>v</em> XQC </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33639-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 82</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">SS 1278 of 2024</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">06 August 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Lim May Li (Lim &amp; Ong) for the Applicant; Michael Moey Chin Woon (Moey &amp; Yuen) for the Respondent. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XQB — XQC </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Personal Protection Order</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">6 August 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       SS 1278/2024 (“SS 1278”) was the Sister’s application for a Personal Protection Order (“PPO”) against her Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Both siblings were represented at the hearing before me. Ms Lim May Li (“Ms Lim”) acted for the Sister. Mr Michael Moey (“Mr Moey”) acted for the Brother.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of the matter and reserved judgment. I called for written submissions. Having considered the written submissions filed by Ms Lim and Mr Moey, judgment was delivered on 9 May 2025. I allowed the Sister’s application in SS 1278 with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       There was no dispute as to the relevant legal principles that apply to an application for a PPO. An applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, the following two requirements in order to succeed in their application for a PPO (<em>WSD v WSE and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30956-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 1</a> at [20]; <em>XMZ v XNA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33304-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 60</a> at [2]; <em>XMS v XMR and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33324-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 56</a> at [5]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, that family violence (as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> “had been committed, or was likely to be committed” against a family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, that it is necessary for the protection of that family member that the court grant a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       I found that the Brother had indeed committed an act of family violence, specifically, that he had, in an incident on 1 February 2024, caused hurt to his sister by “such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt” (to borrow the language of limb (<em>b</em>) of family violence in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Sister had produced CCTV footage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> It showed the Brother chasing her. He caught up to her and tried to grab her by the neck. The Sister can be seen trying to break free from his grasp. The Brother pushed her up against the wall and grabbed her by the throat. The Sister only managed to break free when one of the employees intervened.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In his written submissions, Mr Moey argues that the injuries which the Sister says she sustained “could not have been serious”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> That said, the definition of family violence as set out in limb (<em>b</em>) only includes acts which have caused hurt, or ought to have been known to result in hurt – and “hurt” is defined as “bodily pain, disease or infirmity”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In short, it mattered not whether the injuries, which the Sister allegedly sustained in this scuffle on 1 February 2024, were severe.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I found that the Brother’s actions, namely, grabbing the Sister by the neck, “ought to have been known to result in hurt”. That much was clear from the CCTV footage which showed how the Brother had grabbed the Sister by the neck.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having found that the Brother had committed an act of family violence on the Sister, I turned to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO. The law makes it clear that this involves a risk assessment as to whether the respondent is likely to, going forwards, commit family violence on the person sought to be protected under the PPO: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Ms Lim argued that it was indeed necessary to order a PPO. She emphasised that parties were likely to have future interactions with each other as they both continue to manage and run the family business.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Ms Lim also highlighted that the Brother remained deeply antagonistic towards the Sister as was evident from the various audio and video recordings that were played in court. In that regard, Ms Lim drew my attention to the various threats that the Brother had made against the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Finally, and in addition to those points, Ms Lim highlighted that the evidence showed an escalation in the family violence, and that the underlying cause of the family violence remains unresolved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     On the other hand, Mr Moey argued that a PPO was not necessary for the Sister’s protection. He stated that the Sister had only begun to film the Brother in 2024, and that this resulted in the incidents of family violence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Mr Moey also alluded to the fact that while it was true that the two siblings had to work together as they continued to run the family business, it was always open to the Sister to relocate her operations to one of the other properties that she owned. That she refused to do so, and insisted on staying, was telling of the fact that she knew that her Brother would not harm her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I found it necessary to order the PPO in the present case. For one, it was abundantly clear that the Brother had a fiery temper, and that he would direct his rage at the Sister. The videos and audio recordings amply demonstrated that. The manner in which the Brother had reacted demonstrated that he was, indeed, deeply antagonistic towards the Sister.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     While it may be the case that the Sister would provoke the Brother by deliberately filming him, I must point out that it was always open to the Brother to choose how he wished to react.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Further, given that both the Brother and Sister would still be involved in running the family business, and that entailed being physically on-site at the premises, this would mean that they are likely to come into contact and have future interactions with each other. While there was much made of the fact that a degree of separation between the two siblings could be achieved if the Sister simply moved out – the point remains that the both of them are still involved in the family business, and that means that, in all likelihood, they would continue to have interactions with each other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I therefore allowed the Sister’s application in SS 1278. In addition, I also ordered that both parties go for counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As to the costs of SS 1278, Ms Lim argued that costs should be fixed at $25,000 (all-in) in favour of the Sister, taking into account the length of the trial, the number of documents filed, and the number of witnesses that testified.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Mr Lim, on the other hand, argued that costs should be fixed “in the region” of $16,000 to $17,000 (all-in).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Given that the Sister had prevailed in her application, she was entitled to costs. Having regard to the length of the trial which took 2 full days before me, the number of affidavits filed and the number of witnesses, I fixed costs at $10,000 (all-in). I also ordered that these costs be paid by the Brother to the Sister by 20 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I conclude with a few words to both parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     If one looks across culture and history, it is clear that the bond between siblings has always been a strong and celebrated one. For instance, there is a saying that “blood is thicker than water”. In the Edda (which is a collection of old Norse poems), the ending of the world was marked by brothers fighting each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In this connection, I would say: do not so hastily abandon the ties of kinship that you share. Set aside your grievances and to try to work on rebuilding your relationship as siblings. I have heard evidence of how the both of you were once close.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> I see no reason why that cannot be the case going forward, but you must both be willing to put in the work to mend what has been broken. In that vein, take the counselling seriously. It is meant to equip you with the necessary tools with a view to tackling the underlying cause of your conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     It remains for me to thank Ms Lim and Mr Moey for their able assistance.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>References to provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 are references to the provisions in force prior to 2 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Video titled MCST CCTV Footage Attack 2024-02-01.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Brother’s Written Submissions at para 43.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Brother’s Written Submissions at para 96.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Snorri Sturluson (Anthony Faulkes trans.) <em>Edda</em> (Everyman, 1987) at p 53: Brothers will fight and kill each other, cousins will break the bonds of their relationship.

Their relationship had soured after Y’s marriage with her Husband (“Z”) had broken down. Y had discovered that Z had been unfaithful to her. After attempts to rescue the marriage had borne no fruit, Y filed for divorce. There were also cross-applications between Y and Z for a personal protection order (“PPO”). Those applications had been dealt with at a previous hearing before another judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The problems which Y faced in her relationship with Z also put a strain on her relationship with X. Two incidents had taken place which led to the both of them filing cross-applications for a PPO against each other. SS 506 of 2024 (“SS 506”) was X’s application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against Y. SS 508 of 2024 (“SS 508”) was Y’s application for a PPO against X.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard the trial of both matters over several days and reserved judgment after hearing oral submissions from both parties. Judgment was delivered on 23 April 2025. These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The incidents complained of in SS 506 and 508</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both parties relied on the same two incidents in support of their application for a PPO. I set out a broad sketch of both incidents based on what parties had set out in their complaint forms and affidavits filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The first incident had taken place on 8 January 2024 (the “8 January Incident”). Y had sent the son to school. X, and Z had gone to the school to pick up the son as they both wished to celebrate his birthday.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The actions of X and Z drove Y into a panic especially when Z refused to provide her with details of where he had taken the son. Y commenced a search for the son. Acting on a hunch, she went to the home of X’s sister (“P”) – she suspected that both X and Z had brought the son there.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Y’s hunch turned out to be correct. She encountered X, and P at the lift lobby with her son. She picked him up and tried to leave. A tussle ensued. Both X and P tried to pry the son out of Y’s arms. Afraid that her son would be injured in this tussle, Y set him down. X and P took the son back up to P’s house. The son was returned to his school the next day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The second incident had taken place on 11 March 2024 (the “11 March Incident”). Both Z and Y had brought their son for a speech therapy session. On the way to this session, Y received a notification, on her mobile application, that a stranger had appeared at the doorstep of the matrimonial flat. Perturbed, Y asked her mother (“Q”), to drop by the matrimonial flat to see what was going on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       When Q arrived, she saw that X was having the lock to the matrimonial flat changed by a locksmith. Y later returned to the matrimonial flat with Z and their son in tow. The son had taken ill, and vomited all over himself. The helper took him to the bathroom. A quarrel ensued as both X and Y wanted to help bathe the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Y cried for help. Q ran over. She tried to film the incident. But before she could do so, X intervened. X and Q got into a fight. Y, seeing this, tried to break up the fight. According to Y, a scuffle had then ensued between herself and X. In this scuffle, X had pushed her several times and in so doing, exerted “physical violence onto” her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     X, on the other hand, alleges that in this scuffle, Y had bitten her. She tendered photographs of the alleged bite mark, as well as a medical report and called Z as her witness to testify that he had seen Y bite X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The police were called and their arrival defused the situation. The police took statements and X subsequently sought treatment for the alleged bite mark at the Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law on Family Violence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     It is well established that to succeed in obtaining a PPO, an applicant must prove the following two requirements on the balance of probabilities (<em>XJB v XJC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32868-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 21</a> at [5] citing <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> (“<em>XFL</em>”) at [13] – [14]; <em>XEP v XEQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32394-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 95</a> at [5] – [7]; <em>XDV v XDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32454-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 87</a> at [12])):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That an act of family violence, as defined in s 64 of the Women’s Charter 1961, had been committed, or it was likely that the respondent would commit family violence; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That it is necessary of the protection of the family member in question for a PPO to be granted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The law also makes it clear that there is no need for an applicant to prove that family violence had actually been committed – rather, it would also suffice to show that the respondent will likely commit family violence on the family member in question. That much is clear from the pre-emptive purpose of a PPO which is meant to protect, and not to punish: <em>XFL</em> at [16] and [17].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether X’s application in SS 506 should be granted</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     I shall deal first with X’s application in SS 506.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 8 January 2024 </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In relation to the incident that took place on 8 January 2024, I do not find that Y had committed any act of family violence on X. It was clear to me that Y had, obviously, become agitated and distressed when she discovered that her son had been taken from school without her permission. Yet despite this, she did not, when confronting X, hurl any vulgarities towards her – that much was apparent from X’s testimony,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> and what X had set out in her written statement.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I note that X had alleged, in her written statement, that Y had “acted violently” and “lunged forward” to grab the son by force.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> X, however, did not in her testimony, describe Y as having acted violently and lunging forwards.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     There is, however, the evidence of P that I must consider. P was present at the scene and had been involved in the scuffle between X and Y. P testified that Y had indeed lunged forwards in a violent fashion – she says that the way Y had acted left her so traumatised:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"15.3%\"><col width=\"84.7%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Okay, okay.

It was apparent to me that she had come to court with an agenda: that was to paint a certain picture of Y in the hopes that this would strengthen X’s case. There were three key factors that, when considered together, pointed me to this conclusion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     For one, her witness statement<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> was materially similar in several aspects to the statements that were produced by both X<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and Z.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The reason for this became clear. P admitted that she had, in preparing her statement, discussed her evidence with both Z and X:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"16.64%\"><col width=\"83.36%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">P:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Yah.

Hmm, no.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     That P had discussed her evidence with both X and Z meant that, based on this point alone, I could not give full weight (if any at all) to her evidence. The difficulty that arises when witnesses hold such discussions on their own is that each individual memory of the event in question becomes increasingly coloured by the recounting provided by the other witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The second factor was P’s attempt to exaggerate the trauma she had suffered as a consequence of Y’s allegedly violent behaviour on that day. During the course of P’s testimony, she had broken down in tears, sobbing, as she recounted the trauma she had allegedly experienced in the confrontation with Y and the ensuing scuffle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     There was, however, video footage that was produced. It showed P directly involved in the tussle with X and Y as the three of them fought to gain and maintain control over the son. P’s actions, as captured by the video, directly contradicted both her testimony and demeanour in court where she sought to portray herself as being deeply traumatised by Y’s actions on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Finally, there was what P had said to Y in the course of cross examination:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    And would you describe yourself as someone who’s easily influenced?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">P:    Um, I---I do get influenced but I think I know what is right and wrong. And to me, never, never add violence in front of a kids is very, very, very important to me. So, I hope you take this from me, lah, please, [Y]. Please don’t---don’t let [your son] go through this kind of thing. Never---whatever hate you have for [Z] or his family, just between you and the family but don’t---don’t---</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     What the transcript does not, and cannot, capture, is the tone that P had used. It was apparent to me, from P’s tone, that she had seized the opportunity to lecture Y, and in so doing, attempted to paint a picture of Y as someone who not only acted irrationally, but also bore a deep hatred and resentment towards Z and his family.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I therefore do not accord any weight to P’s testimony. In my judgment, I do not find that X has established that Y had acted violently in this incident on 8 January 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     To sum up, when this incident on 8 January 2024 is viewed in its proper context, it is clear that Y had not committed family violence on X. One must bear in mind that Y was embroiled in bitter divorce proceedings with Z. The battle lines had been drawn between herself, Z and her in-laws. Y had discovered that Z as well as X had taken her son out of school. What she did not know was where the son had been taken to and if she would ever see him again. To be separated from him in this fashion had obviously left her in no small amount of distress – after all she was very closely attached to her son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Yet despite the emotional turmoil she must have felt, it was clear that Y had acted assertively, but not aggressively. She did not hurl any vulgarities or verbal abuse towards either X or P. She did not physically assault them. All she did was to try to take her son with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Incident on 11 March 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I come now to the second incident X had complained of. The crux of X’s complaint was that in the altercation on 11 March 2024, Y had not only threatened and verbally abused her, but had also bitten her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In relation to X’s allegation that Y had bitten her – there are, to my mind, two material issues. First, was the injury that X had suffered actually a bite mark? Second, if that injury was indeed a bite mark, was Y responsible for biting her?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     As proof of the bite injury she had sustained, X tendered several coloured photographs showing an enormous bruise on her right shoulder. She also produced a photograph of a doctor’s electronic report showing that the wound had been diagnosed as a “human bite”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and that she had received a tetanus injection as treatment for that wound.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Although X had produced evidence to show that a doctor had diagnosed the injury as a bite mark, it is important to understand how the doctor had arrived at this conclusion. During her testimony, X explained that she had told the doctor that she had been bitten.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> X also confirmed that her basis for saying that she had been bitten was based on what the police had told her – namely, that they had examined her right shoulder and told her that she had sustained a bite injury.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     X further explained that this was what the doctor had subsequently told her:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"12.62%\"><col width=\"87.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright.

That being said, X was unable to state whether the doctor did inform her of the basis for the diagnosis. It is therefore difficult to ascertain if the doctor had diagnosed the injury as a bite wound purely based on their inspection of the injury in the exercise of their professional experience and skill, or whether the doctor’s diagnosis was partly or wholly based on what X had told them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Given this, I would be slow to accept the doctor’s diagnosis as proof that the injury X had sustained was indeed a bite wound. I would also add that having looked at the pictures X had tendered as proof of her alleged bite injury, I do not see any teeth marks. Given the evidence before me, I do not find that X had established that the injury she had sustained on her right shoulder was indeed a bite wound.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This leads me to the second issue: even accepting that the injury in question was a bite wound, did Y actually bite X?</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     X testified that during the altercation with Q, she had felt a sharp pain on her right shoulder. She stated that she only found out, later on, that she had been bitten.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> X also explained that she did not feel any saliva on her skin, and that was because the clothes she was wearing covered her right shoulder where she had allegedly been bitten.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     There was, however, one person who had witnessed the incident: Z. This was what he had to say:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span></p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"13.96%\"><col width=\"86.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Well, what I want to know is who had bitten your mother?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Z:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">So, um, I witnessed---what---what I had witnessed, uh, from the toilet in [the matrimonial flat] was that both Y and Q ---uh, were pushing Z into the master bedroom and trying to close the door on her. So, I saw that Y was positioned on Z’s right shoulder. Z was basically trying to resist going in. And, uh, Q---Y’s mother was positioned on the left side of her shoulder. So, I did not see the bite actually happening because Y’s head---the back of her head was facing me so I couldn’t see the bite happening. But I did see her head making contact with X’s shoulder. So, I did not see the actual bite happening, but I did see that---that, um, that the in---that the---the head making contact with the shoulder. And subsequently, in, uh, which is also why after bathing my son, in video 3 of X’s affidavit, that was recorded by me---uh, showing me res---uh, re---rescuing my mother from the room that Y had trapped X in.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     While Z admitted that he did not see Y bite X, his account suggested that Y had indeed done so given that her head was positioned at X’s right shoulder during the scuffle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I am, however, not inclined to accept Z’s account of events. For one, Z admitted, under cross-examination, that he did not tell the police about the bite.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> This was what he had said, and the explanation he had provided:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. So, at any one point, did the police ever ask you about the bite and who bite---who---whether you see someone biting your mother or anything. Anything, did you tell the police about the bite?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    No.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. So, if you said that you didn’t tell the police about the bite at all, may I know why the police actually WhatsApped you to ask you about the bite?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    The police---as I’ve mentioned, the police asked me about the bite because my mother showed the bite mark to the police where I took a photo of the bite mark and that’s why he knew that I took a photo, and he asked me for the pho---for the photo. But in---in his account---in his statement-taking for me he did not ask me about the bite, he was asking me about what had happened in video 1 and video 2 of the affidavits, of the videos that I’ve recorded and of the incident that happened within the guest toilet for video 2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. So, just to be very clear, I think, [Z], you---you said that the police did not ask you anything about the bite. So, when did you actually discuss about the bite and, you know, the possibility of me actually was the one biting your mother? Was it during [the incident at the matrimonial flat] or was it after?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    That was after. During the enti---during the incident itself, I was also still processing, Your Honour, what had happened in video 2, given that I had not expected [Y] to do something so irrational and drastic to pretend to be hurt, fall down, hit me as---as per the video and go between my legs. I don’t think any rational person will go between someone’s legs. So, I was still---I was still trying to process what had happened. Especially I was also thinking about how would [the son] view this. That was---tho---those were the things on my mind which is also---also explains why my priority at that point in time was to ensure that I could bathe him and calm him down. So, everything was processing simultaneously, but I made sure within the same day to then to pen down what I’ve---what I’ve written here in my witness affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. Let me see how do I rephrase this. So, the moment your mother actually went to you and say, “Hey, son, someone bite me,” you did not actually tell her on the spot that, “Hey, I think it is [Y] because she was standing next to your---your shoulder.” You also did not ask her, “Mother, who is the one who bite you?” Did you ask her these questions?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    Your Honour, I was still processing what had happened as I’ve mentioned and also processing from [the son’s] point of view and those were not the immediate questions that I had asked until I had seen the bite on my mother. So, at that point in time, when I seen the bite on my mother at 1:03pm, like what I mentioned, when the police---when she showed the bite mark to the police officer, that was my first time viewing the bite mark. And then my mother at that point in time, she mention that it was probably [Y]’s mother who bit her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. Let me stop you here. Thank you. So---so, you said that at 1:03pm, which is very specific, you said that at 1:03pm, that’s when you first discovered that your mother’s right shoulder had a bite and then that’s also at the same time when you finish processing. So, you actually had a chance to ask her, “Hey, Mother, who bite you?” Correct?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    I did not ask her who---who bit her, because at that point in time as I’ve mentioned, I was processing what was happening so that I can recount my own experience to the police. So, I let my mother relay what she had---what she---what she had herself witnessed first-hand to the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. Thank you. So, when you say that your mother relay to the police, were you there as well when she relayed this?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    Yes, I was.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Y:    Okay. So, what did---this is a very good witness statement. So---so---sorry, since you were next to her, can you tell me what did she tell the police regarding the bite? Did she say that I was the one who bite her, or my mother was the one who bite her?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Z:    I think I’ve answered this question, Your Honour. But to further---to further elaborate on [Y]’s question, after that had happened, as I’ve mentioned during the night when I was penning down---I was penning down what had happened during this incident, I recounted about where each party was situated and that’s why I’ve mentioned earlier that while I did not see---whilst I did not see the actual bite taking place, [Y] was positioned over her right shoulder. So, this was something that subsequently I informed my mother that [Y] was ac---was over your right shoulder, [Y]’s mother was on your left shoulder. So, going by the basis of logical inference, between the 2, it was [Y] who bit you because I did see her shoulder---I mean her head coming into contact with your shoulder. So, this was something I recounted to my mother whilst I was penning down my---my thoughts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I find it rather telling that Z did not interject when X had told the police that she suspected that it was Q who had bitten her. This is especially since he had claimed to have witnessed the entire incident, especially the moment where Y’s head was positioned at X’s right shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Apart from this inconsistency in Z’s evidence, there is also his credibility as a witness which was, in my judgment, severely undermined by three factors which I outline below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The first was the fact that he had discussed his evidence with both P and X. Z was strenuously cross-examined on this point by Y – he was asked, at length, whether he had, in drafting his witness statement to the court, discussed his evidence with X and P. Z repeatedly denied having done so.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> That said, Z did admit that he had discussed the incidents which had taken place with both P and X, but denied that he had made reference to, or instructed them on how to draft their own statements.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Then there are also the similarities between Z’s statement, and that produced by X. For example, paragraph 10 of Z’s witness statement is a carbon copy of paragraph 24 of X’s witness statement. There were also identical descriptive phrases used in both their witness statements. The inference which I drew from this was that X and Z had, in all likelihood, discussed their evidence, and edited their respective statements to present a coherent and consistent narrative to the court. In this vein, I also note P’s testimony that she had met up with X and Z and discussed their evidence (see above at [21]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     As a final point on Z’s credibility, it was evident to me from Z’s testimony, and how he had reacted to Y during the course of cross-examination, that he did bear a grudge towards Y. The source of this animosity appeared to stem from, amongst other things, his frustration over not being able to see the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In all fairness, the mere fact that one party bears some animosity towards another does not, without more, naturally mean that they are not a credible witness. In the present case, however, I found that Z’s animosity towards Y, especially when considered in light of the inconsistency in his evidence, and the fact that he had discussed his evidence with P and X, pointed to the conclusion that he was not a credible witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I therefore do not accept Z’s account of the incident, specifically, that Y had bitten X in the scuffle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Apart from Z’s account, X also relied on video footage of Y engaged in a scuffle with Z to support her case that Y had bitten her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> That footage was played in court. X testified that if one looks at the video closely, it shows Y attempting to bite Z – this, according to Z, demonstrated her tendency to bite people.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Y’s response was that she could not have bitten X because she had dental surgery done in the months before this incident. She produced an X-ray showing the affected tooth and explained that it was a molar on the left side of her upper jaw that was affected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span> Y also stated, in cross-examination, that while she was still able to eat, she was unable to consume food such as steak. She stated that she was on painkillers and was unable to bite normally.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     While the evidence does point to Y having had dental surgery, I do not think that evidence went so far as to show that she was incapable of biting people. More importantly, it is X’s burden of proving that Y had actually bitten her, and in so doing, committed an act of family violence. And while X relies on the video footage, I do not find that that footage supports her case that Y had bitten her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     For one, it is difficult to tell from the video, even when it is replayed at a slower speed, whether Y was indeed attempting to bite X, or whether Y was, as she put it, screaming into his shoulder.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In any event, even taking X’s case at its highest and accepting that the video does show that Y had a tendency to bite people when engaged in a scuffle, this does not actually <b><em>prove</em></b> that Y had indeed bitten her in the scuffle on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In summary, I do not find that Y had bitten X in this incident. Based on the evidence before me, I find it more likely that X had sustained the bruise on her right shoulder from the scuffle she was engaged in with Q. Several pictures which were produced, showing bruising on Q’s leg. These pictures not only showed that Q did not walk away from the scuffle unscathed, but also spoke to the intensity of the altercation. In addition, X herself had admitted that she had originally told the police that she suspected that it was Q who had caused the injury on her right shoulder given that the both of them had been engaged in the scuffle.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> That much was corroborated by Q who testified that the police had questioned her about this.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> I do not find that X had provided any convincing reason as to why she had subsequently changed her narrative to state that it was Y who had bitten her on the right shoulder.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     For completeness, I would also add that I do not find that Y had committed any other acts of family violence on X in this incident on 11 March 2024. Insofar as it is alleged that Y had committed family violence on X by pushing her into the master bedroom and attempting to confine her, I find that Y had done so in an attempt to break up the fight between Q and X,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> and that her doing so would not constitute an act of family violence. As for the video footage which showed Y running towards X and holding up a towel – I do not find that this video disclosed any acts of family violence. It is clear from the video that Y was clearly not happy at being filmed, and was attempting to stop both X and Z from filming her. Finally, insofar as it is alleged that Y had shouted at and threatened X in this incident on 11 March 2024, I did not find that this had been established from the evidence. There was, for example, no video or audio recordings that were put before me to prove that point.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether Y was likely to commit family violence on X</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     I now turn to address whether Y was likely to commit family violence on X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     I find that she was not likely to do so. Y clearly once had a cordial relationship with X. Notwithstanding the state of her marriage with Z, I found that she was indeed sincere in wanting to maintain good relations with her in-laws which included both X and P.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> That, however, was not possible given that X had chosen to side with her son, Z. While this deeply disappointed Y, it was apparent to me that she was prepared to move on with her life, and that she was focussed on striving to do the best she could for the sake of the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Necessity of ordering a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     Having found that there were no acts of family violence committed by Y, and that it was unlikely that Y would commit family violence on X, the result is that X’s application in SS 506 must fail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     That being said, I would not have considered it necessary to order a PPO. It is trite law that in assessing the necessity of ordering a PPO, the court undertakes a risk assessment: <em>XKY v XKX and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33099-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 37</a> at [9] citing <em>XFL</em> at [19]. In my judgment, there is a low risk of family violence occurring in the future. For one, both X and Y are no longer living together.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> Further, as I have found (above at [56]), Y was prepared to move on and set her life on a diverging course from X.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Finally, as X had put it, she did not “see any point” in her PPO application, and had actually wanted to drop it – the reason why she had maintained her PPO application was because Y refused to “let th[is] matter rest” and continued to pursue her application for a PPO against Z.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> Although X eventually maintained that her <em>main</em> reason for filing the PPO was because she was worried that Y would cause harm to her, I do not find this to be the case. It was clear to me from the evidence and the testimony of the witnesses that X had not only chosen to take her son’s side in the divorce proceedings, but also that she was willing to take steps to ensure that her son obtained a positive outcome from the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In these circumstances, it would not have been necessary to order a PPO, even if X had succeeded in establishing the first requirement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether Y’s application in SS 508 should be granted </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     I turn now to deal with Y’s application in SS 508. The essence of her case, which was evident from her oral submissions, was that a PPO was necessary to protect her given “evidence of repeated and ongoing harassment” by X.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     Insofar as the law is concerned, as was noted in <em>XFL</em> at [37], to establish family violence under the limb of “continual harassment”, the following three requirements must be shown:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    The respondent has committed “harassment” – i.e., an act of annoying or worrying the applicant by putting pressure on him/her or saying or doing unpleasant things to him/her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    The harassment is “continual” – i.e., repeated, repetitive.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    The respondent has carried out the continual harassment with the intention or the knowledge that it is likely to cause “anguish” – i.e., severe pain, mental suffering, or unhappiness – to the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Based on the two incidents that Y had complained of, I find that X’s conduct had indeed amounted to continual harassment. I explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The background to these two incidents, and indeed, these two applications for a PPO, arises from the breakdown of the relationship between Y and Z. Both X and Y do not dispute that attempts were made at salvaging the relationship – to that end, discussions involving X, Y and Z were held in an attempt to find common ground.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     It was apparent that the reason why no common ground had been found was X’s insistence on moving into the matrimonial home to ensure that a divorce on the basis of 4 years separation could proceed without any issues.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> X therefore knew that, at least to Y, this was not an arrangement that she was comfortable with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Although X had testified that it was Z who had asked the locksmith to come and change the locks of the matrimonial flat on 11 March 2024,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span> and Z had also said the same in his testimony,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_35\" id=\"Ftn_35_1\"><sup>[note: 35]</sup></a></span> I find that, in all likelihood, it was X who had asked Z to do so.

That’s all.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Apart from this, a video had also been played – in that video, Q had asked why the lock was being changed.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_37\" id=\"Ftn_37_1\"><sup>[note: 37]</sup></a></span> X’s response is telling, she had said, with a rather satisfied expression on her face, that the matrimonial home was her house.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_38\" id=\"Ftn_38_1\"><sup>[note: 38]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     That X had the locks of the matrimonial home changed was, in my judgment, an act that caused Y no small amount of worry. This was because her belongings were still in the flat, and she would occasionally drop by to do some work as this made it more convenient for her to pick up the son after his school had ended for the day.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> That Y was worried about losing access to the matrimonial home was also evident from how she had asked her mother to drop by the matrimonial home on the 11<sup>th</sup> of March 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_40\" id=\"Ftn_40_1\"><sup>[note: 40]</sup></a></span> as she had received a notification that there was a stranger at the door of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     Apart from this, there is also X’s conduct in relation to the incident on 8 January 2024. X testified that she had made plans with Z to take the son from school to celebrate his birthday.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_41\" id=\"Ftn_41_1\"><sup>[note: 41]</sup></a></span> While much was made of the fact that Z had the right to see the son given that he was the father, the fact remains that X had indeed participated in taking the son from the school. Not only that, she had actively resisted when Y tried to take the son back – that much was made clear by the video footage which showed X desperately clinging on to the son. Given the circumstances, that both Y and Z were going through a divorce, and that issues relating to care, control and custody in the interim were disputed, such an act on X’s part would undoubtedly cause Y no small amount of anxiety. In this vein, I also find that X knew that taking the son from the school, without informing Y, would cause her no small amount of unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     In my judgment, when both incidents are considered together and in the context of the divorce proceedings between Y and Z, they do demonstrate that X had engaged in a pattern of conduct that did amount to continual harassment whilst affording her a measure of plausible deniability. It must be remembered that the period of time in which these incidents took place was one of heightened emotions, and strained tensions. X must have known this. Yet, she chose to wade into the fray through her actions such as having the lock on the matrimonial home changed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     I would add that even if X’s conduct was not sufficiently repetitive to meet the threshold of continual harassment, I find it likely that X would continue with this pattern of conduct. As I had noted above (at [59]), the battle lines had been very clearly drawn, with X choosing to side with her son and she was willing to take steps to ensure that her son, Z, obtained a positive result from the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The necessity of ordering a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     I consider it necessary to order a PPO in respect of Y’s application in SS 508. As I have explained, it is apparent to me that X’s pattern of conduct was motivated by a desire to ensure that Z obtained a positive result in the divorce proceedings which have yet to conclude.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In the circumstances, Y’s application for a PPO in SS 508 is allowed. A PPO is needed to enforce a clear degree of separation between X and Y, and to ensure that X does not, through her actions, increase the acrimony in the divorce process or frustrate any arrangements relating to the care, control and custody of the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     In addition to this, I also order that X and Y attend counselling. The purpose of this is to provide the both of them with the tools to better manage their conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     As a final point, I deal with the issue of costs. Y asked for costs to be fixed at $15,000, taking into account the fact that the matter had gone through six days of trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     X’s submission in reply was that a more reasonable figure would be $1,000 to $1,500.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     Given that Y had succeeded in her application, and in defending against X’s application, she is entitled to costs. In fixing the quantum of costs, I considered the principle in <em>Arokiasamy Steven Joseph v Lee Boon Chuan Nelson</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30422-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 291</a> where the court observed that costs awarded to self-represented persons are typically lower than in cases where the litigant is represented by counsel. In the circumstances, and having regard to matters such as the length of the trial before me, I fixed costs at $3,500 (all-in). I ordered that this sum be paid by X to Y by 4 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     I must stress that my finding of continual harassment in SS 508 should not be taken as laying down a broader proposition that any involvement by an in-law in their children’s ongoing divorce proceedings will always amount to continual harassment. After all, family violence can take many different forms and the assessment as to whether there was indeed family violence, or the likelihood of family violence being committed, is one made based on the facts before the court in light of the relevant context.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     I conclude with a few remarks to X:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It is understandable that you would want to support your son as he navigates his way through the divorce proceedings. But there are better ways of showing your support. You must also consider how Y would perceive your actions and how they might impact her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_79-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The PPO I have ordered does not, and should not preclude either yourself or Y from working to rebuild the cordial relationship that you both once shared.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>These applications were made prior to the changes to the Women’s Charter that came into effect on 2 January 2025.

Chung:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The parties are the mother (the “Mother”) and the father (the “Father”) and of a girl (the “Child”) born in 2021. They are not married to each other, and do not have a registered civil partnership.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The Father is a French citizen who works in Singapore on an Employment Pass as the Chief Operating Officer of a company. The Mother is a Dutch citizen who is in Singapore on a Long-Term Visit Pass tied to the Father’s Employment Pass. The Mother’s last job was with a company in Singapore, at which she worked for 1 year and 7 months, before being retrenched in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Mother claimed that she has been unable to secure employment in Singapore since. The Child has both a French passport and a Dutch passport, and is in Singapore on a Dependant’s Pass tied to the Father’s Employment Pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Until March 2025, the parties and the Child were staying at an apartment (the “Apartment”) leased in the Father’s name. According to the Mother, since the parties’ relationship broke down in August 2024, the Father has pressured the Mother to leave the Apartment without the Child. The Mother claimed that the Father abused her “psychologically and orally”, and insisted that she get her own apartment. While the Father offered to pay rental for a few months for a serviced apartment for the Mother, the Mother claimed that this was on condition that she formally agreed to sign the care arrangement for the Child that the Father wanted.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Mother claimed to be the Child’s primary caregiver. The Mother found the Father’s proposal to engage a nanny to look after the Child while the Father was at work unsatisfactory.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       After the Father sent the Mother a “Formal Notice to Vacate” the Apartment on 8 March 2025, under which the Mother was given until 12 March 2025 to leave the Apartment, the Mother and the Child left the Apartment on 18 March 2025 and moved to a crisis shelter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There are 2 cases before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The first case is FC/OAG 57/2025 (“OAG 57”). This is an application by the Mother against the Father under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 for the following reliefs:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.     <b><u>Urgency</u></b> - The [Mother] applies for this application to be heard on an urgent basis for reasons set out in her supporting affidavit filed in [support] of this application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.     <b><u>Custody, Care and Control</u></b> - The [Mother] and the [Father] (collectively, the “<b>Parties</b>”) shall have joint custody of the Child, [particulars of the Child redacted] with care and control to the [Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">3.     <b><u>Passports and Other Official Documents</u></b> - The [Mother] shall at all times be the custodian of [the Child’s] official documents including her Dutch and French passports, her birth certificate, her health booklet, and such other documents belonging or relating to [the Child].

This is an application by the Father against the Mother under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 for the following reliefs:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.    Parties shall have joint custody of [the Child] [particulars of the Child are redacted].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.    The [Father] shall have sole care and control of the Child, with the [Mother] to have access to the Child.

Both parents shall have equal rights and access to all other official documents of the Child, including but not limited to her birth certificate and health booklet, which have been safekept by the [Mother] and shall be handed over to the [Father] within two (2) days of written request being made. Neither parent shall unilaterally withhold any of the Child’s documents or use them to restrict the other parent’s access to or decision-making for the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">6.    Costs to be paid by the [Mother].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable general principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Under section 5 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1934 (“GIA”), the Court may, upon the application of either parent, make orders as it thinks fit regarding the custody of, the right of access to, and the payment of any sum towards the maintenance of, a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Under section 3 of the GIA, where in any proceedings before any Court the custody or upbringing of a child is in question, the Court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, and neither parent of the child is deemed to have any right or claim superior to that of the other in respect of such custody.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As observed by the High Court in <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 0769.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 769</a>, at [22] to [24], when making a decision as to what will promote the welfare, and is in the best interests, of a child, the Court takes into account a number of relevant circumstances, including the need for both parents to have an involvement in the child’s life, the child’s wishes, the child’s relationships with relatives, and the importance of maintaining the ties of affection the child enjoys.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     However, the Court’s power under section 5 of the GIA does not extend to making orders relating to the immigration status of a parent of a child. As observed by the Family Division of the High Court in <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26340-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 27</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27138-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1469</a>, at [8], [13] and [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A wife’s application for an order to compel her husband to apply for a Long-Term Visit Pass for her is not in itself an application on the custody, access or maintenance of a child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the wife is essentially asking the Court to assist her in obtaining a specific immigration status to remain and work in Singapore, it is for the wife to show how such an order is related to the custody application, such that the order is also an appropriate order that is in the child’s welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where the main interest the wife is pursuing is to obtain a long term immigration status that allows her to live in Singapore, the proper authority to which the wife should apply for the necessary permission to stay and work in Singapore may be the Ministry of Manpower or the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, but the Court is not the appropriate forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     As there were overlapping issues in the 2 cases before me, instead of dealing with each case in turn, I propose to deal with each set of related issues in those cases collectively, and to make a single Order in relation to both OAG 57 and OAG 73.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Custody of the Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Both prayer 2 of OAG 57 and prayer 1 of OAG 73 contemplate that the Father and the Mother will have joint custody of the Child. Therefore, in respect of prayer 2 of OAG 57 and prayer 1 of OAG 73, I order that the Father and the Mother shall have joint custody of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Care and control of, and access to, the Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Prayers 2, 7(a) and (c) and 8(a) of OAG 57 and prayers 2 and 3 of OAG 73 deal with the care and control of, and access to, the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother seeks care and control of the Child, and proposes that the Father be given reasonable access to the Child in Singapore, on such terms as the Court may stipulate. If the Court grants the Mother permission to relocate with the Child to the Netherlands, the Mother proposes that the Father be granted access to the Child in the Netherlands on the terms set out in the Mother’s affidavit filed in support of OAG 57 or on such terms as the Court may determine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father also seeks care and control of the Child, and proposes that the Mother be given reasonable access to the Child. The Father proposes in the alternative that the parties have shared care and control of the Child, with care arrangements to be determined by the Court. The Father also seeks an order that the Mother return the Child to the Apartment on an immediate basis.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The evidence suggests that the Mother may not be able to find suitable employment in Singapore. The Mother’s existing qualifications are fairly generic, and she will face stiff competition for employment in Singapore from similarly qualified Singapore citizens and permanent residents. In order for the Mother to work in Singapore, she will need to hold an Employment Pass, which she will not qualify for unless she is able to obtain a job with a minimum fixed monthly salary of $6,000. The Mother has attested to her failed attempts at securing employment in Singapore after her retrenchment in 2021.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass, which is set to expire in February 2026, was granted on the basis that she was the common-law spouse of the Father. This was evidenced by an “ATTESTATION SUR L’HONNEUR DE VIE COMMUNE” (or “ATTESTATION ON HONOUR OF COHABITATION”) made by both parties, the English translation of which states that the parties “have been living in a common-law marriage since 01/03/2014” (see Tab 7 pages 112 and 113 of the Mother’s supporting affidavit filed on 19 March 2025 in OAG 57). The English translation of the Attestation also states that under Article 515-8 of the French Civil Code, “a Cohabitation is a union characterized by the fact of two persons of different sexes or of the same sex living together as a couple in a stable and continuous relationship”. As the parties no longer “live together as a couple in a stable and continuous relationship”, it is unclear whether, for the purposes of the maintenance and renewal of the Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass, the parties remain in a common-law marriage, and the Mother continues to be the common-law spouse of the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     As the Father has made it clear that he will not continue to support the Mother financially, and it is unclear whether the Mother will be able to obtain an Employment Pass or remain in Singapore on a Long-Term Visit Pass after the cessation of the parties’ civil partnership, it necessarily follows that the Mother will have to relocate to the Netherlands, where she has family support and is better placed to find suitable employment. If the Father chooses to remain in Singapore after the Mother’s relocation, then the Father’s alternative proposal for the parties to be given shared care and control of the Child is not a viable option, having regard to the distances that the Child will have to travel each time there is a transfer of care and control from one parent to the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Having regard to the welfare of the Child and what is in her best interests, it would be more appropriate to give the care and control of the Child to the Mother than the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The evidence suggests that the Mother has been the primary caregiver of the Child since the Child’s birth. While the Father may have participated in raising the Child, the Mother played a more significant role in the raising of the Child. I reached this conclusion based on matters that took place before the Mother removed the Child from the Apartment. Further, at the Child’s present age (4 years), she will need the Mother more than the Father. As observed by the Court of Appeal in <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/3677-M.xml')\">[1997] SGCA 49</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 3 SLR(R) 0430.xml')\">[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430</a> at [45] (which was followed in <em>TAT v TAU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17161-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 19</a> at [37]), all other things being equal, when dealing with a young infant, the maternal bond is a pivotal consideration, as an infant of tender age would be most dependent on the infant’s mother for the infant’s physical and psychological needs, and should not be deprived of the mother’s love and care. In <em>CX v CY</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/48305-M.xml')\">[2005] SGCA 37</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 3 SLR(R) 0690.xml')\">[2005] 3 SLR(R) 690</a>, the Court of Appeal observed, at [43], that <em>Soon Peck Wah v Woon Che Chye</em> “is helpful in the determination of who should be granted care and control; it cannot be denied that a young child requires a mother’s daily care”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The care arrangements proposed by the Mother, should she be granted care and control of the Child, were also preferable to the care arrangements proposed by the Father. Although the Mother’s proposal may involve relocation to the Netherlands, the Child would be brought up by the Mother with the assistance of the Child’s maternal grandparents, whom the Mother and the Child would live with. In contrast, the Father’s proposal for the Child’s care when he was at work or away was to delegate the task to a nanny or helper. While the Father mentioned his sister, brother-in-law and nephew as being part of the Child’s “support system”, he made no suggestion that his sister and brother-in-law would actually care for the Child when he was absent. It would be preferable for a young child to be raised by family than a stranger.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father’s equation of the status quo with continuity in the Child’s physical environment (by the Child continuing to stay in the Apartment and attend daycare in Singapore) ignored the Mother’s role in providing stability in the Child’s life, and the reality that the Child needed her mother more than her current physical environment. Once the Mother relocates to the Netherlands, the status quo would cease to exist. It was also not disputed that since the Child’s birth, the parties have moved 4 times, one reason for which was to “protect the family’s financial stability”. So, as far as the Child’s residence was concerned, there was really not much of a status quo to begin with.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I have no doubt that both parents love the Child, and would try their best to take good care of the Child if given care and control of the Child. While each party claims to be the better parent, both parties should be mindful that the decision on who should be given care and control of the Child turns not on who is presented to be the better parent but on what is in the best interests of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     In the circumstances, I order as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother shall have care and control of the Child, and the Father shall have reasonable access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties are to agree on the arrangements for the Father’s reasonable access to the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_21-p2_c\"></a>(c)     If the parties are unable to agree on the arrangements for the Father’s reasonable access to the Child, either party may apply to the Court for directions relating to such arrangements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I do not think it is appropriate for the Court to specify, at this time, the terms on which the Father is to have access to the Child in the Netherlands. As the Mother has yet to relocate with the Child to the Netherlands, and the Child has yet to settle into life in the Netherlands, it is premature to consider the Mother’s proposals, set out in her supporting affidavit filed on 19 March 2025 in OAG 57, in relation to the arrangements for the Father’s access to the Child in the Netherlands. Instead, the parties should first attempt to work out those arrangements on their own, having regard to the welfare and best interests of the Child, before seeking the Court’s intervention.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Relocation</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Prayer 5 of OAG 57 and prayer 4 of OAG 73 relate to the possible relocation of the Child to the Netherlands. The Mother seeks the Court’s permission to relocate with the Child to the Netherlands. On 15 April 2025, the Father obtained an order in terms of prayer 4 of OAG 73, under which the Child shall not be removed from Singapore by a parent without the consent of the other parent or an Order of Court allowing such removal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The relocation of the Child to the Netherlands is inevitable once the following matters are established:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     it is in the welfare and best interests of the Child for the Mother to be given care and control of the Child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Mother may not be able to find suitable employment in Singapore, and consequently may not be able to support herself financially if she remains in Singapore; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Father will not support the Mother financially if she remains in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In addition, there are benefits to the Child if she relocates to the Netherlands. Upon relocating to the Netherlands, the Child would be entitled to the benefits available to Dutch citizens, such as free primary and secondary education, and subsidised further education. The Child would also be covered by the Mother’s mandatory health insurance up to the age of 18 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In the circumstances, I order as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother is given the permission of the Court to relocate with the Child to the Netherlands.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The relocation is to take place according to a schedule that is agreed to by the parties or determined by the Court (if the parties are unable to agree on the schedule).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_26-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother is not to relocate with the Child to the Netherlands except in accordance with that schedule.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Child’s name</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Prayer 4 of OAG 57 deals with the Mother’s application for the Mother’s surname to be inserted into the Child’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Section 5 of the GIA empowers the Court to make orders regarding the custody of an infant. In <em>UPD v UPC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23903-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 25</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24875-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 4 SLR 699</a> at [77], the High Court held that the changing of the name of a child goes towards the child’s identity, and since this is a long term matter affecting the child’s welfare, it would be a matter that relates to custody. It follows that the Court has power under section 5 of the GIA to make orders regarding a child’s name.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The cases cited by the Mother’s counsel illustrate how that power is to be exercised.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In <em>L v L</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0529.xml')\">[1996] SGCA 40</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1996] 2 SLR(R) 0529.xml')\">[1996] 2 SLR(R) 529</a>, a father applied for an order that his daughter by a dissolved marriage, whose surname had been changed by the mother by deed poll, revert to the father’s surname. The mother changed the daughter’s surname in February 1991 without the father’s knowledge. The father discovered the name change in January 1995, when the child started schooling. The Court of Appeal granted the father’s application on appeal, and held at [22] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the surname of a child is the symbol of the child’s identity and the link between the child and the child’s father; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     to change the surname of a child was thus a serious matter, and the Court will not countenance such a change unless there are compelling reasons to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Similarly, in <em>Khor Bee Im v Wong Tee Kee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/6708-M.xml')\">[2002] SGHC 7</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2002] 1 SLR(R) 0055.xml')\">[2002] 1 SLR(R) 55</a>, a father applied for an order that the deed poll changing the surname of his son to that of the son’s stepfather be declared void and inoperative. The High Court found that the child, who was 17 years of age at the time of the hearing, had been known by the stepfather’s surname from the time the child was 7 years of age, that all important documents relating to the child carried the stepfather’s surname, and that the child had no desire to revert to the father’s surname. In the circumstances, it would not be in the child’s interests to make an order that the child’s surname be changed back to that of the father, and there were compelling reasons to countenance the change of the child’s surname.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In <em>UPD v UPC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23903-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 25</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24875-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 4 SLR 699</a> at [99] and [100], the Family Division of the High Court endorsed the following statements:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     A child’s name is a symbol of the child’s identity and relationship with the child’s parents. A change of name or surname is a serious matter, and the Court would not countenance such change unless there are compelling reasons to do so. In deciding whether or not to countenance a name change, consideration should be given to the effect on the child. A change of surname is not necessary just for the child to know that he was the parent’s child. At the end of the day, the welfare of the child is paramount, and overrides any other consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The relevant factors to consider when deciding applications to countenance or allow a change of the name or surname of a child, subject to the overriding consideration of the best interest of the child, include:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       the reasons for the registration of a particular name or surname for the child;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       the reasons given by the parent for seeking to change the child’s registered name or surname;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       the lapse of time between the registration of the child’s name or surname and the attempted change;</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_iv\"></a>(iv)       the impact of any change in name or surname on the child (for instance, in terms of his official documentation such as his school and bank records);</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_v\"></a>(v)       the importance of maintaining a link between the parent and the child through the name or surname after divorce; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b-p3_vi\"></a>(vi)       the wishes of the child on his choice of name or surname where he is of sufficient maturity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     The present case concerns an application by the Mother to change the original name of the Child by adding the Mother’s surname immediately before the Child’s (and the Father’s) surname. The Mother explained the addition of her surname was “a practical and emotional measure intended to support [the Child’s] stability, identity, and well-being in the context of her daily life”. Giving the Child “a surname that reflects her connection to both parents” was especially relevant if the Child was to relocate to and grow up in “a jurisdiction where shared surnames between parent and child are common practice and often expected in institutional settings”. In particular, it would help “avoid awkward questions or logistical difficulties, particularly when [the Mother was] travelling with her alone, [during] school registration, or [in] situations where [the Mother] must provide parental authorisation”. The Mother also observed that “[making] this change now will ensure coherence across [the Child’s] documents and records as she grows”. (See paragraphs 199 to 203 of the Mother’s affidavit filed on 7 May 2025 in OAG 73.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     All things considered, I was satisfied that it will be in the best interests of the Child to allow her name to be modified in the manner proposed by the Mother. This is a case where the parties are not married and, if the parties choose to live in different countries, the Mother will be raising the Child as a single parent. Allowing the Child to also bear the surname of the Mother (in addition to the surname of the Father) will make it easier for the Child to grow up in any society where a child living with a single parent is expected to bear the same surname as that parent. In particular, the Child will not have to explain why the Child has a different surname from the Mother. This may also facilitate immigration clearance when the Child and the Mother are travelling together internationally without the Father, as there will be less to explain to immigration authorities. As the Child is still young, any impact of the name change to the Child will be minimal. As the Child will also continue to bear the Father’s surname, the link between the Child and the Father is maintained.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     In the circumstances, the Mother is given the permission of the Court to change the name of the Child, without the consent of the Father, by adding the Mother’s surname immediately before the Child’s (and the Father’s) surname. The normal manner to change a child’s name is by deed poll. As the Mother has not provided any reason for departing from the norm, the Mother should proceed in that manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Child’s passports and other official documents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Prayer 3 of OAG 57 and prayer 5 of OAG 73 deal with the retention of the Child’s passports and other official documents. The Child has both a Dutch passport and a French passport.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother applied to be the custodian of the Child’s passports, birth certificate, health booklet and other similar documents, and for the Father to hand over to the Mother any such documents that are in his possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_36-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father applied for the Mother to retain the Child’s Dutch passport and the Father to retain the Child’s French passport, for both parents to have equal rights and access to all other official documents of the Child (including the Child’s birth certificate and health booklet), and for the Mother to hand over to the Father any such documents which have been safekept by the Mother within 2 days of written request being made. The Father also applied for an order that neither parent shall unilaterally withhold any of the Child’s documents or use them to restrict the other parent’s access to or decision-making for the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     I assume that the Child has 2 passports because she is both a Dutch citizen by descent and a French citizen by descent. While the Father’s proposal for the Mother to retain the Child’s Dutch passport and the Father to retain the Child’s French passport is superficially attractive, I am concerned that this may lead to the Child travelling on different passports at different times, depending on whether the Child is travelling with the Mother or the Father. This may result in an incomplete picture of the Child’s travel records being presented whenever the Child crosses a border, and it is unclear whether this may have any repercussions for the Child in jurisdictions with strict immigration controls. Until such time as the Child elects which nationality or nationalities to adopt, it may be preferable for the Child to travel on the same passport consistently, regardless whether she travels with the Mother or the Father. The parties should decide, between themselves, which of the Child’s passports the Child should use consistently when travelling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     As the Mother has been granted care and control of the Child, with reasonable access to the Father, the Child’s passports, birth certificate, health booklet and other official documents should be retained by the Mother. However, if the Father requires any such document for travel with the Child, or for any other legitimate purpose, the Mother should provide the Father with that document.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I therefore make the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mother shall retain the Child’s official documents (which include the Child’s Dutch passport, French passport, birth certificate and health booklet), but must provide the Father with such of those documents as the Father may require for travel with the Child, or for any other legitimate purpose that the parties may agree to or the Court may determine.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the the Child’s Dutch passport or French passport (whichever is normally used by the Child) is required by the Father for travel with the Child:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       the Mother must provide that passport to the Father at least 7 days before the date on which the travel starts; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       the Father must return that passport to the Mother within 3 working days after the date on which the travel ends.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where the Child’s Dutch passport, French passport, birth certificate, health booklet or other official document is required by the Father for any other legitimate purpose that the parties may agree to or the Court may determine:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       the Mother must provide that document to the Father within 3 working days after the Father makes a written request to the Mother for that document; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       the Father must return that document to the Mother within 3 working days after the date on which that purpose is fulfilled.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance for the Child</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Prayers 7(b), (d) and (e) and 8(b), (c) and (d) of OAG 57 deal with maintenance for the Child. The Mother applied for the Child’s maintenance upon relocation to be determined by the Courts in the Netherlands or the Singapore Family Justice Courts. Pending relocation, the Mother applied for the Father to pay $1,500 per month as maintenance for the Child, as well as the Child’s daycare fees and other expenses currently paid by the Father. If relocation was not granted, the Mother applied for the Father to pay such reasonable maintenance for the Child as is determined by the Court, if not agreed upon by the parties, as well as housing for the Child (in the form of a 1­bedroom furnished studio apartment with basic amenities including cooking facilities) and interim maintenance comprising: (a) a monthly allowance of $1,500 for the Child’s daily expenses; (b) the Child’s daycare fees and all other expenses that the Father was currently paying for; and (c) housing for the Child (in the form of a 1-bedroom furnished studio apartment with basic amenities including cooking facilities).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     I am of the view that the Mother’s application for the Father to put her and the Child up in a 1-bedroom furnished studio apartment in the interim is extravagant and unjustified. The evidence also suggested that this was beyond the Father’s means. The Mother has not provided any convincing reason why the Mother and the Child cannot return to the Apartment. There was no evidence of any physical violence being applied to the Mother or the Child. Given the Child’s need for the Mother, the Father cannot reasonably expect the Child to return to the Apartment without the Mother. The impetus for the Mother to leave the Apartment with the Child was the Father’s threat to evict her. That can be easily addressed by the following orders, which I make:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Pending the relocation of the Mother and the Child to the Netherlands, the Mother and the Child may return to the Apartment, stay in the bedroom that was previously occupied by them, and have full access to the cooking facilities and other amenities in the Apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_41-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Unless the Court orders otherwise, pending the relocation of the Mother and the Child to the Netherlands, the Father must not evict the Mother from, or force the Mother to leave, the Apartment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     To enable the Child to continue her early childhood development with minimal disruption, I order the Father to continue to pay for the Child’s daycare fees and other educational expenses currently paid by the Father, pending the Child’s relocation to the Netherlands. This does not extend to any expenses currently paid by the Father that are the subject of the Mother’s claim for a monthly sum for the maintenance of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The Mother provided the following tabulation of the Child’s monthly expenses at paragraph 167 of her supporting affidavit filed on 19 March 2025 for OAG 57:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"50%\"><col width=\"50%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Expense Item:</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Amount (S$)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Contribution towards housing</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$200.00</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Groceries</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$800.00</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Outside Food</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$100.00</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Toiletries / wipes / diapers</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$100.00</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Apparel</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$100.00</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Outing / entertainment</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$200.00</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am of the view that the Mother’s tabulation overstates the Child’s monthly expenses. The contribution towards housing should be excluded, if the Mother expected the Father to provide her and the Child with accommodation, whether in the Apartment or otherwise. As the Child is only 4 years old, the total of $900 per month claimed for groceries and outside food is excessive. $500 a month should be adequate for groceries and food for a child of that age. $100 a month for toiletries, wipes and diapers is reasonable. I would allow $75 a month (or $900 a year) for apparel, given that the Child is at an age where she is growing. I would round the amount of reasonable maintenance for the Child to $700 per month, to cater for miscellaneous expenses (such as outings and entertainment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     While the Mother clearly has earning capacity, I accept that she is unable to find a suitable job in Singapore, and consequently will not be able to contribute to the maintenance of the Child while they remain in Singapore. Therefore, pending the relocation of the Mother and the Child to the Netherlands, the Father should bear the entire amount of maintenance for the Child. The maintenance for the Child will have to be reconsidered after the relocation of the Child to the Netherlands, as the Child’s expenses in the Netherlands may be very different from those in Singapore, and the Mother should be able to contribute to the Child’s expenses after finding suitable employment in the Netherlands.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In the circumstances, in addition to the earlier orders relating to the Child’s accommodation and the Child’s daycare fees and other educational expenses, I order that pending the relocation of the Mother and the Child to the Netherlands, the Father is to pay the Mother $700 per month for the maintenance of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     Prayer 5 of OAG 57 concerns the Mother’s application regarding her own Long-Term Visit Pass. As explained earlier, the Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass was granted on the basis that she was the common-law spouse of the Father. As the parties have ceased to be in a civil partnership, the status of the Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass is unclear.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     I make no order on the Mother’s application to compel the Father not to cancel the Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass for so long as she remains in Singapore, as it was clearly misconceived. As observed in <em>VLI v VLJ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26340-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHCF 27</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27138-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1469</a>, at [8], this application is not in itself an application on the custody, access or maintenance of a child, and so falls outside the ambit of the Court’s powers under section 5 of the GIA. The question whether the Mother remains entitled to remain in Singapore on a Long-Term Visit Pass granted to her as a common-law spouse after the cessation of the parties’ civil partnership is a matter to be determined by the Ministry of Manpower or the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority, and not the Court. In any event, the Father has repeatedly assured the Mother that he has no intention of cancelling the Mother’s Long-Term Visit Pass.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Interim orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     Prayers 1 and 9 of OAG 57 concern the urgent hearing of that case for the making of interim orders. I make no order on those prayers, as I have dealt with the case on its merits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Costs and other orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     Prayer 11 of OAG 57 and prayer 6 of OAG 73 concern costs. Generally, in cases of this nature, where the care and control of a child is in issue, and the child’s parents are unable to agree on what is in the best interests of the child, the Court would usually order each party to bear his or her own costs. In making such an order, the Court is mindful that the parties will have to continue working together in raising the child, and the Court seeks to avoid potentially aggravating any acrimony between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     In the cases before me, the Mother substantially succeeded in obtaining the main reliefs sought in OAG 57.

The application was made under r 405 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR 2014</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard parties on 27 May 2025 and issued my judgment with my reasons to the parties on 5 June 2025. I now set out my grounds of decision containing these reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       By way of background, the parties were married on 16 January 2003. They have one child who is now 19 years old and serving National Service.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       On 5 February 2024, the Plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings on the ground that the marriage had irretrievably broken down due to the parties having lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ, pursuant to s95(3)(<em>e</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>WC</b>”). Specifically, the Plaintiff averred that she had ended the <em>consortium vitae</em> in 2009 and thereafter lived apart from the Defendant under the same roof but in different households at the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The present application arose in the following context. After being served with the writ, the Defendant filed the Original D&amp;C which the Plaintiff submitted suffered from the following main defects:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     First, instead of responding to the Statement of Claim and Statement of Particulars, it was structured as a response to the Memorandum of Appearance.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Second, it contained no proper paragraphing or page numbers.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Third, rather than defending the Plaintiff's specific case based on separation since 2009, the Defendant instead appeared to be explaining that separation occurred because of the Plaintiff’s own conduct and has not otherwise provided a defence.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Fourth, it devoted substantial portions to ancillary matters such as custody, care and control of the child, division of matrimonial assets and maintenance. These were matters that were prematurely raised at the divorce stage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Fifth, while purporting to include a counterclaim, the Original D&amp;C failed to properly plead any ground under s 95(3) of the WC for the irretrievable breakdown of marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Plaintiff's position was that these defects rendered the Original D&amp;C liable to be struck out as it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious and/or it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action and or is otherwise an abuse of the process of court.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> The Plaintiff also highlighted that the Original D&amp;C failed to comply with the formal requirements under r 56 of the FJR 2014.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The key question before me was therefore whether the Original D&amp;C should be struck out, allowing the divorce to proceed uncontested on the fact of separation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My judgment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Under r 405(1) of the FJR 2014, the court may strike out any pleading or anything in any pleading on the grounds that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Rule 405 of the FJR 2014 is derived from O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 332 R5). As such, it is uncontroversial that the case law applicable to that rule is similarly applicable to the present application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The power to strike out is considered draconian and should only be invoked in “plain and obvious” cases: <em>The “Osprey”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099.xml')\">[1999] 3 SLR(R) 1099</a> (“<b><em>Osprey</em></b>”) at [6]. After careful consideration of parties’ submissions and the evidence before me, I was satisfied that this was not an appropriate case to exercise the court’s draconian power of striking out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     While the Original D&amp;C filed by the Defendant was deficient in that it was not filed in Form 21 as required under r 56(4) of the FJR 2014, I noted that the substance of his defence was discernible from several portions of the document. Although he did not expressly state that he is denying separation, his Original D&amp;C contains numerous allegations about:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff’s alleged psychological abuse and control over food, finances and his daily life;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     His position that there has been “no separation” but rather an ongoing abusive marital relationship where the Plaintiff exercises control over him; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     His allegations about the Plaintiff’s continuing ability to exert influence over him through the provision and withholding of sustenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     At the hearing before me, the Defendant forcefully argued and clarified that it is his position that there was no separation. In other words, he <em>did</em> dispute the fact of living apart that the Plaintiff relies on. He emphasized that there was an “ongoing” relationship characterized by a “massive power imbalance” in favour of the Plaintiff. Significantly, he articulated that the Plaintiff’s alleged unreasonable behaviour and ability to exercise control over him through the provision and withholding of sustenance demonstrated the absence of separation. As he put it, “she cannot do unreasonable behaviour with me if she has no ongoing relationship with me. She has no control to subject me to it.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     From my understanding, the Defendant’s position, while perhaps not articulated in conventional legal terminology in his Original D&amp;C, appeared to be that the Plaintiff’s alleged unreasonable behaviour was not merely a counterclaim but evidence that <em>negates</em> the very fact of separation itself. He contended that the very nature of the alleged abuse and control demonstrated an ongoing marital relationship rather than lives lived apart. This, to my mind, was his defence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The stringent requirements for striking out of defence and counterclaim under the law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Plaintiff’s counsel fairly accepted at the hearing that this Court possesses the discretion to allow the amendment of the defence and counterclaim rather than striking out, though he maintained that any such amendment “must be legally and factually sustainable [to challenge the] living apart claim.” To the Plaintiff counsel’s credit, this submission recognized that amendment rather than striking out may be the more proportionate response where deficiencies in pleadings could be cured.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     To reiterate, the position at law is clear that the court’s power to strike out a statement of claim, whether under the Rules of Court or under the court’s inherent jurisdiction, is only exercised in a plain and obvious case: see <em>Osprey</em> at [6]. The courts will let a party proceed with an action unless his case is “wholly unarguable”: <em>Blue Town Investments Ltd v Higgs and Hill plc</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/17491-E-M.xml')\">[1990] 1 WLR 696</a> at 901. Thus, it has been stated by the Court of Appeal that in general, the court’s approach to an application to strike out the statement of claim is to consider if the deficiency or defect therein could be cured by an amendment, and the court would prefer to allow an amendment rather than to take the drastic course of striking it out: <em>Ching Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of Tan Geok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit and Another Appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 1 SLR(R) 0053.xml')\">[2000] 1 SLR(R) 53</a> at [12].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The above principles must be so given that the act of striking out is considered a hard and exacting chastisement on a party’s case. Striking out effectively shuts the door on a party’s case: for a detailed exposition of r 405 of the FJR 2014, see <em>VHP v VHQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24436-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGFC 40</a> (“<em>VHP</em>”) at [48] <em>per</em> DJ Azmin Jailani.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The present case is not a plain and obvious case for the court to exercise its powers to strike out the Defendant’s pleadings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Bearing in mind the principles above, I parted ways with Plaintiff’s counsel on his characterization of what would be “legally and factually sustainable” – an inquiry which I note is relevant to the invocation of at least one of the limbs to striking out. As I have noted above, the Defendant’s case, while perhaps inelegantly pleaded, raised arguable issues about whether there has truly been separation in light of the alleged continuing control and influence exercised by the Plaintiff. These issues deserved proper ventilation at trial.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     While the Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that unreasonable behaviour cannot be used as a defence to a claim of separation, and that the only defence was to deny the fact of separation with particulars, I emphasised that in this case, the allegations of unreasonable behaviour were being used to demonstrate why there was no separation rather than as a standalone ground for divorce. This presented an arguable case that should not be shut out at this stage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I appreciated the Plaintiff’s counsel insistence that the Defendant has no credible defence against the claim of separation and that the Plaintiff had a strong case on this front in her favour, it was not this court’s role here to determine the merits of the Defendant’s defence and/or counterclaim. The court’s role at this stage was solely to determine whether this is an appropriate case for striking out and/or amendment where the real issues in dispute can be properly surfaced by the grant of an amendment. The law is clear that striking out is an option of last resort. As I have stated above, there were genuine issues to be tried regarding the dispute over separation and unreasonable behaviour. The Defendant had a right to be heard on the dissolution of his marriage, and I was reluctant to shut out his voice by striking out his D&amp;C at this stage. The Plaintiff could pursue her arguments against the merits of the Defendant’s defence and counterclaim before the trial judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I also appreciated the point that proceeding on the purportedly undenied claim of separation would likely save parties much grief as it is a no-fault ground. However, I could not shut out the Defendant’s right to be heard at this stage through the drastic option of striking out. The Plaintiff was, of course, at liberty to seek the necessary case management directions in the lead up to trial, including the possibility of bifurcation of the facts of divorce proceeded on (<em>ie</em>, separation in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim and unreasonable behaviour in the Defendant’s Counterclaim) – a possibility raised by Plaintiff’s counsel at the hearing as a course of action he may explore – , if appropriate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The New D&amp;C sought to be adduced</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The question then turned to the scope with which permission should be granted to the Defendant to amend his pleadings. In this regard, I examined the new D&amp;C exhibited in the Defendant’s Reply Affidavit at p 48 (“<b>New D&amp;C</b>”). This has been prepared using the Form 21 as required under r 56(4) of the FJR 2014. While the correct form may have been used, I noted that the pleadings have not framed in a way which is self-contained, as it contained numerous cross-references to other documents rather than setting out the particulars within the pleading itself. The Defendant stated in the New D&amp;C that these cross-referenced documents “must be considered collectively”.

style=\"max-width: 100%;height: auto;height:352.943944444444pt;width:213.151194444444pt;\"></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Putting this issue aside and considering the trite principle that the court should not carry out a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case (<em>Antariksa Logistics Pte Ltd and others v Nurdian Cuaca and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21348-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 3 SLR 117</a> at [79]), when I turned to look at the substantive contents of the New D&amp;C, I was satisfied that there were the following viable elements of both a defence to separation and a counterclaim based on unreasonable behaviour:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Defendant explicitly stated at VD-2D that “there has been no separation, this is ongoing marriage where plaintiff has been consistently engaging in abusive and unreasonable behaviour towards the defendant.” He elaborated at VD-10 that there has been “no separation, instead there has been ongoing marriage in which the plaintiff has been consistently abusive... in a master-slave ongoing marriage where jobless defendant is the slave at the mercy of earning plaintiff who holds the massive power over him.” (see also VD-12, where he repeats his claim that there is no separation). This was articulated at the hearing when the Defendant argued that the Plaintiff’s very ability to control and abuse him demonstrates an ongoing relationship rather than separation: “she cannot do unreasonable behaviour with me if she has no ongoing relationship with me. She has no control to subject me to it.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     As for his counterclaim of unreasonable behaviour, the Defendant had set out specific instances including allegations of the Plaintiff withholding sustenance and locking food in containers, restricting access to shared assets and financial resources, verbal and psychological abuse, a knife threat incident in 2005 and parental alienation (see New D&amp;C at para 2). He explicitly pleaded at paragraph 3(b) of the New D&amp;C that “the Plaintiff has behaved in such a way that the Defendant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Plaintiff.” He provided context for how this behaviour allegedly arose: after he lost his job in 2009, the power dynamic shifted and the Plaintiff allegedly began exercising control through financial means and denial of basic necessities, among other allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     While these pleadings could have been drafted in a self-contained manner, without the cross-references made therein, I was satisfied that there are sufficient details to establish both a defence to separation (through the alleged ongoing nature of the relationship manifested through control) and a counterclaim based on unreasonable behaviour. It was evident from both the Defendant’s Original and New D&amp;C that significant efforts have gone into disputing the allegations of the Plaintiff in the statement of claim. It was not atypical to see pleadings at the family courts where parties merely assert that they disagree to certain facts setting out brief particulars of their reason. Such matters have proceeded to trial on the basis of such pleadings without issue. The Defendant has quite evidently gone beyond that, preparing various detailed affidavits and references to support his position. While his method of cross-referencing documents rather than incorporating all particulars within a self-contained pleading may be procedurally incorrect, the substance behind his defence and counterclaim was apparent. This further supported my view that this was not a case suitable for striking out.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I therefore made the following orders:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Plaintiff’s application to strike out the Original D&amp;C was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Defendant was granted leave to file and serve the New D&amp;C in Form 21 as exhibited in his Reply Affidavit by 19 June 2025. The Defendant was to comply with all relevant procedural requirements in filing the amendments to his pleadings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As leave was granted for the Defendant to amend his D&amp;C, I granted the Plaintiff corresponding leave to file and serve her amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. This was to be done by 3 July 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     While I have found that the Defendant should be allowed to proceed with his defence and counterclaim, I urged both parties to carefully consider whether pursuing a heavily contested divorce is truly in anyone’s interests. The parties’ child, though now serving National Service, remained their child. The acrimony evident in these proceedings, if allowed to persist, may cast a long shadow over the parties’ future co-parenting relationship. While both parties have strongly held views about the breakdown of their marriage, there may be wisdom in finding a way forward that allowed both to maintain their dignity while minimizing further conflict.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Finally, I exercised my discretion to make no order as to costs, given the acrimony that is evident between the parties. It was my sincere hope that the parties would take this opportunity to step back and consider whether there might be a better path forward than continued litigation.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at paras 29 and 37.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 9.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Plaintiff’s Written Submissions at para 9.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Procedure – Costs","Family Law – Procedure – Costs – Costs payable to a legally aided person"],"date":"2025-07-28","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2455 of 2023 (Summons No 1426 of 2024)","title":"XDF v XDG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 78","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33603-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Peck Ki (Robert Wang & Woo LLP) for the plaintiff","Simran Kaur Sandhu (I.R.B Law LLP) for the defendant","Davyd Chong and Nurul Iman Binte Abdul Rashid for the Legal Aid Bureau."],"timestamp":"2025-08-05T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Soh Kian Peng","html":"<root><head><title>XDF v XDG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XDF <em>v</em> XDG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33603-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 78</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2455 of 2023 (Summons No 1426 of 2024)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">28 July 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Soh Kian Peng </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Pang Peck Ki (Robert Wang &amp; Woo LLP) for the plaintiff; Simran Kaur Sandhu (I.R.B Law LLP) for the defendant; Davyd Chong and Nurul Iman Binte Abdul Rashid for the Legal Aid Bureau. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XDF — XDG </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Costs payable to a legally aided person</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">28 July 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Assistant Registrar Soh Kian Peng:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This judgment concerns the costs order I had made in relation to SUM 1426. I had ordered that costs be paid to the Wife who was legally aided, and that the Wife, upon receipt of this sum, was to make payment to the Director of Legal Aid (“DLA”) pursuant to s 16 of the Legal Aid and Advice Act 1995 (“LAA”):<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span><em>XDF v XDG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32215-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 82</a>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       Counsel for the Wife, Ms Pang Peck Ki, subsequently wrote in to seek clarification as to whether the costs should be paid to the legally aided Wife, or to the DLA. Given this, I called for submissions from the Legal Aid Bureau (“LAB”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I heard parties on 13 January 2025. Mr Davyd Chong (“Mr Chong”) made oral arguments for LAB at that hearing. Upon the conclusion of that hearing, I ordered that costs be paid to the DLA by 17 January 2025. I now set out the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       First, and as a preliminary point, I considered it open to me to revisit this issue. The order had not been extracted, and so I was not <em>functus officio</em>: <em>VMax Marine Pte Ltd v Singapore Salvage Engineers Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31962-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHC 208</a> at [12] – [17]. Further, at the hearing, counsel for the Husband, Ms Simran Kaur, clarified that her client was ready to pay costs, but he was awaiting my review and clarification on who costs should be paid to.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       In this connection, the point to be clarified was, specifically, whether costs which are payable to a legally-aided person should first be paid to the legally-aided person who is then liable to the DLA for such costs, pursuant to s 16(3) of the LAA – or whether such costs should instead be paid directly to the DLA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       One broad point made by Mr Chong was that the statutory framework contained in the LAA and Legal Aid and Advice Regulations (“LAAR”) enshrined the principle that costs are to be paid to the DLA, who has funded the litigation. In particular, Mr Chong made the point in written submissions that while s 16(3) of the LAA “does not explicitly direct that an order must be made in favour of the DLA, it is clear from the statutory text that any moneys recovered by the aided person in respect of costs must be paid to the DLA”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       I do agree that the costs architecture instantiated in s 16 of the LAA does imply that costs which are recovered by a legally-aided person are to reach the DLA. However, I consider that s 16(3) and (4) of the LAA does not carve out the only procedural mechanism by which this is to be done.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       For one, s 16(3) of the LAA stipulates that where a legally aided person recovers any money in proceedings, or by a settlement or compromise, they are liable to the DLA for costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       That provision, however, must be read together with s 16(4) of the LAA. This is a deeming provision. It defines the phrase “moneys so recovered as is recovered in respect of costs” in s 16(3) of the LAA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The key phrase, however, in s 16(4) of the LAA is this: “so much of the total amount recovered as exceeds the amount (if any) recoverable by the aided person <b>otherwise than as costs</b>” [emphasis added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     One possible interpretation of s 16(4) of the LAA is that any sums recovered by the legally aided person, which are not recovered as costs, are also to be deemed as sums recovered in respect of costs within the meaning of s 16(3) of the LAA, which must also be paid over to the DLA. This accounts for a situation where party-and-party (“P&amp;P costs”) may not fully cover solicitor-and-client (“S&amp;C costs”). To ensure that public funds which had been expended on legal aid may be quickly and effectively recovered, it is therefore necessary to have any moneys recovered by a legally-aided person paid to DLA first. This ensures that the DLA is not put out of pocket for the costs which have been expended on the litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Crucially, s 16(4) of the LAA appears to exclude costs payable to the legally-aided person from this equation. This is apparent from the phrase “otherwise than as costs”. This implies that such costs which are ordered in favour of a legally-aided person should, in keeping with parliamentary intent of ensuring recovery of public monies spent on legal aid, be paid directly to the DLA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I therefore clarified my order to state that costs be paid directly to the DLA, and that this be done by 17 January 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Finally, it remains for me to record my gratitude to Mr Chong for his assistance at the hearing before me.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The Legal Aid and Advice Act was recently amended with effect from 1 April 2025.

They solemnised their marriage on 13 February 2013 in India, and registered their marriage under the Maharashtra Regulation of Marriage Bureaus and Registration of Marriages Act 1998 (in a Register of Marriages maintained under that Act).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 31 July 2024, the Plaintiff commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore. On 7 August 2024, the Defendant filed a Memorandum of Appearance. On 25 September 2024, the Defendant applied to stay the divorce proceedings on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Defendant submitted that India was a more appropriate forum than Singapore to hear the parties’ divorce proceedings, and that there were no special circumstances that require the divorce proceedings to be heard in Singapore. According to the Defendant, the main connecting factors in this case that warrant the grant of a stay in favour of divorce proceedings in India were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As the parties had solemnised their marriage in India in accordance with the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 of India (“HMA”), the dissolution of the marriage will have to be in accordance with the provisions of the HMA, and the Indian Court is best placed to adjudicate on this issue (the “HMA Argument”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties were born in India and remain Indian citizens, and the witnesses to be called for the trial of the action are based in India (the “Personal Connection Argument”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Defendant’s counsel provided the following elaboration on the HMA Argument:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Maharashtra Regulation of Marriage Bureaus and Registration of Marriages Act 1998 complements the HMA, and since the parties’ marriage was solemnised in accordance with the provisions of the HMA, the marriage can only be dissolved based on the provisions of the HMA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     An Indian Court will not recognise a dissolution order made by a Singapore Court if the jurisdiction assumed by the Singapore Court, and the grounds on which the divorce is granted, are not in accordance with the HMA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Indian Court will be in a better position to hear the divorce proceedings and determine whether the grounds for the dissolution of the marriage set out in the HMA are satisfied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Defendant’s counsel also provided the following elaboration on the Personal Connection Argument:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As the parties are Indian nationals, their domicile is deemed to be India. Despite living in Singapore since 2013, neither party has made any significant attempt to gain Singapore citizenship. The Plaintiff returned to live in India from July 2018 to July 2019, and from November 2020 to January 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In the Statement of Particulars, the Plaintiff referred to her relatives and the Defendant’s relatives. The Plaintiff would have to call them as witnesses for the trial. It would be more convenient for these individuals to testify in Court if the proceedings were heard in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Plaintiff’s counsel submitted that Singapore was the natural and appropriate forum to hear the parties’ divorce proceedings, in reliance on the following factors:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Both parties are long term permanent residents of Singapore. Their lives, careers and social ties are deeply entrenched in Singapore. Singapore is their primary residence and domicile of choice. The Plaintiff has no intention of returning to India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The acts of cruelty complained of by the Plaintiff (which form the basis of her allegation that the Defendant has behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant) occurred in Singapore. The relevant witnesses and evidence are readily available in Singapore, making it the most convenient forum for the just and efficient resolution of the dispute.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     While the marriage was solemnised in India, the applicable law for the divorce proceedings is the <em>lex fori</em>, which is Singapore law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The matrimonial home is in Singapore. The Singapore Court is best equipped to determine the division of this asset and other ancillary matters.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The test for determining whether a proceeding commenced in Singapore ought to be stayed on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> is the “<em>Spiliada</em> test” set out in <em>Spiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/68440-E-M.xml')\">[1987] AC 460</a>. In <em>BDA v BDB</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2012] SGHC 0209.xml')\">[2012] SGHC 209</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 1 SLR 0607.xml')\">[2013] 1 SLR 607</a> at [22], the High Court described the test in the following terms:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">22    The <em>Spiliada</em> test consists of two stages. In stage one, it must be shown that there is another available forum which is clearly or distinctly more appropriate than Singapore to determine the dispute. The court shall take into consideration factors not only encompassing convenience or expense, but also other factors such as the law governing the transaction and the places where the parties respectively reside or carry on business. If there is another available forum which is clearly more appropriate, the court will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a stay should nevertheless be refused. The latter is the second stage of the <em>Spiliada</em> test, under which the court shall consider whether those special circumstances exist to warrant the exercise of its discretion to refuse a stay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The High Court in <em>BDA v BDB</em> also made the following observations at [24]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The <em>Spiliada</em> test is essentially a factors-based test: the weight to be placed on the various factors varies with each factual matrix. A factor that proves to be the tipping point in one case might not be that important in another.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_b\"></a>(b)     However, the defendant’s residence does appear to be of some import. Where a defendant seeking a stay is working and residing in Singapore, there lies a greater evidential burden on him: the countervailing factors adduced in favour of the stay have to be correspondingly more convincing, in comparison to where the defendant is not resident in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In the present case, both the Plaintiff and the Defendant work and reside in Singapore, and are Singapore permanent residents. This gives the parties a strong connection to Singapore. While the parties are Indian nationals, nationality <em>per se</em> is of limited significance as a connecting factor, as compared with residence. As the High Court observed in <em>BDA v BDB</em> at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">While not entirely discounting nationality as a connecting factor, nationality <em>per se</em> is of limited significance. In an increasingly globalised world, multiple nationalities are becoming the norm. Residency and/or domicile are better indicators of the strength of a party’s connection to a particular forum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Another factor that makes Singapore an appropriate forum is the location of the matrimonial assets. The parties’ main matrimonial asset is their matrimonial home located in Singapore. A Singapore Court would be better equipped than an Indian Court to make orders relating to the division of the matrimonial home and the refund, to the parties’ Central Provident Fund accounts, of any sums withdrawn by the parties for the purchase of the matrimonial home. Further, an Indian Court would not be able to grant relief under section 31 of the Family Justice Act 2014, if such relief is required to effect the transfer or sale of the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I consider the location (and compellability) of witnesses to be a neutral factor, as there are witnesses in both India and Singapore. Many of the material witnesses, to whether the Defendant has behaved in such a way that the Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Defendant, are in Singapore, as most of the Plaintiff’s complaints against the Defendant relate to matters that took place in Singapore. However, the Plaintiff’s Statement of Particulars also mentions both parties’ relatives in India, and the roles that they played in the breakdown of the parties’ marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The applicable law for the divorce proceedings is also a neutral factor. As the applicable law for divorce proceedings is the <em>lex fori</em> (or law of the forum), it follows that the applicable law would be Singapore law if the divorce proceedings are heard in Singapore, and Indian law if the divorce proceedings are heard in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The place where the marriage took place is another neutral factor. The parties agreed that the courts in India do not have exclusive jurisdiction to dissolve a marriage solemnised and registered in India. This is borne out by the Indian Supreme Court decision of <em>Y Narasimha Rao and others v Y Venkata Lakshmi</em> (1991) 3 SCC 451 at [13], which both parties relied on.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my opinion, the HMA Argument is relevant only if there are concurrent proceedings in India and Singapore, or there is a need to enforce a divorce judgment granted by a Singapore Court in India. Where the only matrimonial proceedings between the parties are commenced in Singapore, and there is in fact no need to enforce the divorce judgment in India, any reliance on the HMA Argument is wholly misconceived. Whether a Singapore Court has jurisdiction to hear the parties’ divorce proceedings is a matter of Singapore law. As there are no concurrent matrimonial proceedings in India, the issue of whether it is more appropriate for the Indian Court than the Singapore Court to hear the matrimonial proceedings, because the Indian Court might not recognise a divorce judgment granted by a Singapore Court, does not arise. The question whether an Indian Court will recognise a divorce judgment granted by a Singapore Court is academic, unless there is in fact a need to enforce the divorce judgment in India. The cases of <em>Sanjeev Sharma s/o Shri Sarvjeet Sharma v Surbhi Ahuja d/o Sh Virendra Kumar Ahuja</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17202-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHC 104</a> and <em>WFU v WFV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/27890-SSP.xml')\">[2022] SGFC 67</a>, which were relied on by the Defendant’s counsel, concerned concurrent proceedings in India and Singapore, and were therefore distinguishable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I add for completeness that <em>WFU v WFV</em> was reversed on appeal. While the Family Division of the High Court did not issue grounds of decision explaining why the appeal was allowed, the decision suggests that the appellate court did not agree with the argument that an Indian Court cannot recognise a Singapore divorce judgment because “irretrievable breakdown of marriage”, which is the sole ground for divorce in Singapore, is not a ground for divorce under the HMA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     When I asked the Defendant’s counsel, during the hearing before me, whether the Defendant had commenced any divorce proceedings in India, or intended to do so, the Defendant’s counsel admitted that the Defendant had not filed any proceedings in India, and had not discussed whether he will do so in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The Plaintiff’s counsel indicated that the Plaintiff was not seeking any assets in India, and that there was no need for the Plaintiff to enforce the judgment in India. The Plaintiff’s counsel also submitted that even if there was a need to enforce the judgment in India, the Indian Courts would recognise the Singapore judgment, and it was up to the Defendant to raise the issue should the Plaintiff seek to enforce the judgment in India.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The parties did not dispute that under Singapore law, a Family Court has jurisdiction under section 93(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961 to hear the parties’ divorce proceedings. If the parties to the marriage reside in Singapore, the matrimonial assets are located in Singapore, and there is in fact no need to enforce a Singapore divorce judgment in India, then it begs the question why the Plaintiff should be compelled to restart the divorce proceedings in India, when the judgment is to be enforced in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Defendant’s counsel also submitted that if the Defendant goes back to India, and the Singapore divorce judgment is not recognised in India, then the Defendant “will be in a dilemma and cannot be remarried in India”. However, the short answer is that the alleged dilemma is really of the Defendant’s own making. It is not disputed that under the Indian Supreme Court decision of <em>Y Narasimha Rao and others v Y Venkata Lakshmi</em> at [13], an Indian Court would recognise a Singapore divorce judgment if “the respondent voluntarily and effectively submits to the jurisdiction of the forum ... and contests the claim which is based on a ground available under the matrimonial law under which the parties are married”, or if “the respondent consents to the grant of the relief although the jurisdiction of the forum is not in accordance with the provisions of the matrimonial law of the parties”. If the Defendant is genuinely concerned about whether an Indian Court will recognise a Singapore divorce judgment dissolving the marriage between the parties, it is open to the Defendant to submit to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Court, or to consent to the grant of a divorce judgment by the Singapore Court, subject to the parties’ agreement on the facts on which the divorce is to proceed. If the marriage between the parties has in fact irretrievably broken down, it may be more productive for the parties to try to reach an agreement for the divorce to proceed on less contentious facts, than to argue over the choice of forum. The ancillary matters can of course be adjourned for determination by the Singapore Court on a later date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The burden is on the Defendant to show that there is another available forum that is clearly and distinctly more appropriate than Singapore. As the Defendant has not discharged the burden of showing that India is clearly and distinctly a more appropriate forum than Singapore, the Defendant’s application is dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     As the Plaintiff has successfully resisted the Defendant’s application, and costs should follow the event, I order the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff the costs of the application, such costs to be agreed between the parties or (failing agreement) fixed by the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     If the parties are unable to agree on costs, each party is to tender written submissions on the quantum of the costs payable by the Defendant to the Plaintiff, confined to 3 pages (excluding the cover page). The Plaintiff’s written submissions should quantify the disbursements claimed by the Plaintiff, and the Defendant’s written submissions should comment on the Plaintiff’s quantification of the Plaintiff’s disbursements. For this purpose, the Plaintiff’s solicitors are to provide the Defendant’s solicitors a list of disbursements (and their amounts) claimed by the Plaintiff.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Procedure – Reference to pre-trial discussions in a party’s written submissions for hearing on ancillary matters – Whether reference is proper","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Wife unemployed for five years – Applicable considerations – Considerations for determining duration of spousal maintenance – Section 114(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Section 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2025-07-22","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3029 of 2024 (Ancillary Matters)","title":"XOS v XOT","citation":"[2025] SGFC 75","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33559-SSP.xml","counsel":["Clement Yap, Jasmine Chang (M/s Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Husband","Kishan Pratap (M/s Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-07-30T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XOS v XOT</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XOS <em>v</em> XOT </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33559-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 75</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 3029 of 2024 (Ancillary Matters)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">22 July 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Kow Keng Siong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Clement Yap, Jasmine Chang (M/s Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Husband; Kishan Pratap (M/s Kishan Law Chambers LLC) for the Wife. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XOS — XOT </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Reference to pre-trial discussions in a party’s written submissions for hearing on ancillary matters</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Whether reference is proper</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Former wife</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Wife unemployed for five years</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Applicable considerations</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Considerations for determining duration of spousal maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Section 114(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961</span></p> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Law</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Maintenance</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Child</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Section 69 of the Women’s Charter 1961</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">22 July 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Kow Keng Siong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The Plaintiff-Husband (German national) and the Defendant-Wife (Chinese national) were married in 2009.

She contended that, prior to the commencement of divorce proceedings, the Husband had already agreed to pay this amount in maintenance, in addition to separately covering other expenses. However, he later reduced the amount to $10,000/month.

The Husband stated that he had suggested that the parties monitor the actual expenses incurred by the Wife and the son before reaching a mutually agreed amount. He further explained that he had agreed to pay interim maintenance of $8,000/month solely to secure the Wife’s withdrawal of (a) her maintenance application (MSS 1174/2024), and (b) her application for a personal protection order (SS 1056/2024).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       I reject the Wife’s reference to the pre-trial discussions in support of her case. I wish to take this opportunity to express my concern with such references in general.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As a matter of general principle, such discussions are conducted on a “without prejudice” basis and are therefore inadmissible in determining the substantive issues before the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     This principle holds particular significance in the family justice context, where the Court adheres to the framework of therapeutic justice. Therapeutic justice promotes reconciliation and encourages the amicable resolution of disputes as the preferred way forward. For this approach to be effective, parties must be able to engage in pre-trial discussions openly and candidly, without fear that their statements may later be used against them in litigation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     To reference such discussions in submissions is to undermine the very foundations of therapeutic justice. It erodes trust between parties, heightens adversarial tension, and detracts from the goal of preserving relational stability.

At the material time, she had felt unsafe remaining in Hong Kong due to the widespread violence and civil unrest arising from the protests against China. (The Wife is a Chinese national.)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     I find the Husband’s evidence to be plausible. The large-scale protests in Hong Kong during 2019 and 2020 – marked by significant violence and civil unrest – were widely reported in the media. The unrest stemmed from, among other things: (a) opposition to an extradition bill that would have permitted the transfer of criminal suspects to mainland China; (b) alleged misconduct by the Hong Kong Police Force; and (c) broader tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China.

He contended that the domestic helper was responsible for accompanying the child to school and enrichment classes, and that he himself had attended the child’s school meetings and birthday celebrations.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I do not find the Husband’s assertions sufficient to displace the Wife’s evidence that she has been the son’s primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The mere fact that a domestic helper assisted with certain logistical tasks, such as bringing the son to school or enrichment classes, does not negate the Wife’s overarching caregiving role. It is common for parents to rely on domestic assistance, and the involvement of a helper does not, in itself, undermine a parent’s status as the primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Likewise, the Wife’s absence from the son’s school meetings and birthday celebrations does not, in my view, indicate a lack of interest in his life. According to the Husband’s own evidence, the Wife refrained from attending these events due to her concern about her limited proficiency in English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> Moreover, the Husband’s involvement in such events does not negate the possibility that the Wife undertook the day-to-day caregiving responsibilities. These include attending to the child’s daily needs, managing his routine, and providing continuous supervision and emotional support – tasks she was well positioned to perform, given that she was not gainfully employed during the relevant period.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I have no reason to doubt the Wife’s evidence that she ceased working in order to be the son’s primary caregiver. This conclusion is supported by the following undisputed facts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Husband would not have been in a position to give reliable and direct evidence on the Wife’s daytime caregiving role, as he was likely occupied with work commitments during those hours.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, as noted at [21] above, the Wife has not been gainfully employed in Singapore since relocating in 2020. She would therefore have had the capacity to attend to the child’s daily needs and overall welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_25-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the Husband had consented to the Interim Judgment granting the Wife care and control of the son. This indicates his acknowledgment that the Wife was the more appropriate parent to meet the child’s day-to-day emotional, developmental, and practical needs. See <em>TSF v TSE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22417-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 2 SLR 833</a> at [67] to [69]; <em>AZZ v BAA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18707-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 44</a> at [72]. This acknowledgement is likely to have been based on, among others, the fact that she had been the son’s primary caregiver: <em>XDZ v XEA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32327-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 90</a> (“<b><em>XDZ</em></b>”) at [14(a)] to [14(d)].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     In summary, I find that the Wife had made significant sacrifices for the marriage by remaining a stay-home mother over the past five years to care for the son. This prolonged caregiving role provides a compelling basis for her claim for spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Are the Wife’s assets limited</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I shall now consider the Wife’s financial position and assess whether she requires financial support: see [12(b)(i)] above</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s response</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Husband submitted that, contrary to the Wife’s assertion, she possesses significant assets.

He contended that these funds could have been applied toward meeting her own expenses and those of the child.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     I make the following observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Withdrawal of $35,000.</em> I find that the $35,000 withdrawn by the Wife in May 2024 would likely have been substantially, if not entirely, depleted by the time of this judgment. The estimated monthly living expenses of the Wife ($3,800/month) and the son ($4,600/month) is approximately $8,400/month in total: see <b><u>Annex B-2 (18)</u></b> and <b><u>Annex C (24)</u></b>. The $35,000 would have covered just over four months of their expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>ORSO Fund</em>. The Occupational Retirement Schemes Ordinance (“<b>ORSO</b>”) is administered by the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority, Hong Kong’s statutory body overseeing both MPF and ORSO schemes.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> In my view, the ORSO fund should not be treated as a readily available resource for the purposes of assessing the Wife’s ability to support herself post-divorce. The fund is a form of retirement savings subject to statutory restrictions on withdrawal under Hong Kong law. There is no evidence to suggest that the Wife is currently eligible to access the funds, nor that early withdrawal is permitted without penalty. It would be inappropriate and unfair to require her to rely on funds earmarked for her long-term financial security – particularly where she lacks other stable sources of income and is still in the process of re-establishing economic independence. As such, I do not consider the ORSO fund to be a disposable asset that can be considered when determining the necessity or quantum of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Huizhou apartment</em>. According to the Wife, the apartment will need renovations before it can be rented out to generate income. I have no reason to disbelieve her evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Hong Kong BCT Fund</em>. This is a pension fund and is thus illiquid.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Excluding the ORSO Fund, the Huizhou apartment, and the Hong Kong BCT Fund – none of which are presently liquid or readily realisable – the Wife’s disposable assets amount to approximately $174,271.03. This sum represents her share in the matrimonial asset as provided under the Interim Judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In my view, it is not reasonable for the Wife to rely solely on this amount to meet her living expenses post-divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_a\"></a>(a)     As of the date of this judgment, the Wife is 47 years old. The average life expectancy for women in Singapore is approximately 85 years. This means that she may have nearly four decades ahead of her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_32-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Based on the evidence before the Court, I estimate the Wife’s personal living expenses to be approximately $3,800/month, or $45,600/year: see <b><u>Annex B-1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex B-2</u></b>. If she were to rely exclusively on her disposable assets ($174,271.03) to cover these expenses, these assets will likely be exhausted in fewer than four years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Can the Wife find employment in Singapore</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33      <u>Ability to work</u>. Does the above analysis mean that the Wife is entitled to spousal maintenance? The short answer is no. The law does not presume that a wife is entitled to spousal maintenance solely because she is unemployed. Section 114(1)(c) of the Women’s Charter 1961 expressly requires the Court to consider her “earning capacity” in determining whether maintenance should be ordered. Thus, a wife who claims that she is unable to work must prove this claim. For instance, if the inability to work is claimed on medical grounds, then she must adduce relevant and persuasive medical evidence to support her case: see e.g., <em>UWM v UWL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26780-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGCA 105</a> at [26]. Likewise, if a wife contends that she cannot work because she needs to care for her child, then she must show (a) why the child’s needs preclude her from working, (b) that she has explored all reasonable alternatives, and (c) that none of these are viable: <em>TYS v TYT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21175-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 5 SLR 244</a> at [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34      <u>Efforts to secure employment</u>. Where the wife is assessed to have earning capacity, the Court will examine whether she has made genuine and sustained efforts to seek employment. Mere token attempts or an unduly narrow search – such as limiting applications to certain industries or roles – will not suffice: <em>TXU v TXV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19957-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 19</a> at [22].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35      <u>Estimated income</u>. The Court will also consider what the wife could reasonably be expected to earn upon re-entering the workforce. This involves an assessment of factors such as (a) her academic and professional qualifications, (b) her age, (c) her employment history, (d) her previous income, and (e) prevailing market conditions. See <em>ANZ v AOA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0243.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 243</a> at [71] and [72] (considerations for assessing earning capacity); <em>CYH v CYI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29284-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 4</a> at [63] (wife’s earning capacity assessed to be higher than her last drawn salary one year before her unemployment); <em>WGJ v WGI</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29413-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 11</a> at [36] (wife’s earning capacity pegged to the last drawn income one year before her unemployment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36      <u>Possible outcomes</u>.

The Husband highlighted that her email correspondence with the German Embassy was written entirely in English, which, in his view, contradicts her claim of limited English proficiency.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_38-p2_c\"></a>(c)     As for her assertion that she suffers from various health issues – such as gastritis and breast lumps – and requires regular medical attention,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> the Husband pointed out that no supporting medical evidence has been tendered to show that these conditions impair her ability to work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband further submitted that, despite their separation in June 2024, the Wife has made minimal efforts to secure employment in Singapore. He emphasised that she previously earned over $18,000/month between April 2018 and March 2019. Even accepting that her earning capacity may now be reduced, he estimated that she should still be capable of earning approximately $9,000/month, which would be more than sufficient to meet her monthly expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Having considered the parties’ submissions and the evidence before me, I find that while the Wife may face some challenges in re-entering the workforce, these do not render her unemployable. Her educational qualifications, prior work experience, and past earnings indicate that she possesses marketable skills. The fact that she had previously held managerial positions and operated a business reflects a degree of professional competence and entrepreneurial initiative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Although the Wife has cited age, language barriers, and health concerns, there is insufficient evidence to establish that these factors substantially impair her ability to work. Notably, no medical reports have been produced to substantiate her claims of ill health. As for her English proficiency, the evidence (e.g., her correspondences) shows that she is functionally literate in English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That said, I accept that the Wife has been out of full-time employment for several years and may not be able to command the same income she once earned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     Considering the Wife’s qualifications, work history, the duration of her employment gap, as well as the relevant salary guides and information,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> I estimate her current earning capacity to be in the range of <b>$3,500 to $4,000/month</b>. This is a conservative approximation that recognises both her professional background and the challenges she may face in re-entering the job market after several years as a homemaker.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Spousal maintenance is appropriate</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Time is needed </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     In my view, the key issue is not whether the Wife is capable of securing employment in Singapore, but how much time she reasonably requires to attain full financial independence. My assessment on this point is as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_a\"></a>(a)     It would not be reasonable to expect the Wife to resume employment immediately. She will require time to identify suitable work opportunities. If she intends to leverage her prior experience by returning to the insurance or financial advisory industry, she must first undertake and pass the requisite regulatory examinations, and obtain the necessary certifications and licences. This process will inevitably take time and preparation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_44-p2_b\"></a>(b)     More significantly, the time required for the Wife to return to work is influenced by the needs of the son, whose welfare remains the Court’s paramount consideration. At 12 years of age, he is entering a formative phase of adolescence and is likely to still require close care, guidance, and supervision. The transition from being cared for by a stay-home mother to adjusting to her working outside the home is one that must be managed carefully to minimise disruption to his well-being.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s assets will be depleted quickly</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     In my assessment, the Wife’s expenses are likely to increase during the transition from being a stay-home mother to becoming fully economically self-sufficient. She will need to incur costs associated with preparing for re-employment, including expenses for professional certification or licensing, transportation to attend job interviews, and possibly enrolling in refresher courses. In addition, she may need to engage childcare support to supervise the son while she attends to examinations, training, or work-related commitments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The assets identified at [28] above represent the Wife’s sole source of financial security. These resources are finite and will likely be depleted during her transition to full-time employment. There is no evidence to suggest that the Wife has access to alternative sources of familial or financial support in Singapore during this period, or in the event of an emergency. The available evidence indicates that her parents reside in China and the Husband now resides in Thailand. This absence of a support network may place significant stress on the Wife, which in turn could adversely affect the welfare of the son – whose well-being remains the primary consideration.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Maintenance is necessary</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, fairness to the Wife and the best interests of the son support the granting of short-term spousal maintenance. Such an order –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Gives due recognition to the sacrifices the Wife made during the marriage by serving as the son’s primary caregiver over the past five years: see [26] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Affords the Wife a reasonable period to re-enter the workforce and regain financial independence: see [44(a)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Cushions the emotional and practical impact of the transition on the son, who is entering a formative stage of development and adjusting to the Wife’s shift from a stay-home to working parent: see [44(b)] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Preserves the Wife’s limited capital from premature depletion, thereby protecting her long-term financial security: see [45] and [46] above; <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [44]; <em>ATE</em> at [31].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     To summarise – A limited maintenance order will provide the Wife with essential transitional support as she works toward resuming economic self-sufficiency. At the same time, it reflects the principle that spousal maintenance is not meant to be indefinite, particularly where the recipient is capable of regaining financial independence with time and effort.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Duration of the maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The next question is how long the spousal maintenance should last. In my view, a period of <b>two years</b> is appropriate in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_a\"></a>(a)     This duration will provide the Wife with a reasonable window to adjust to her post-divorce circumstances, including her transition to full-time employment while continuing to care for the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_b\"></a>(b)     By the end of this period, the son will be approximately 14 years old – an age at which he is likely to have developed greater maturity and independence, thereby easing the practical demands on the Wife as a working parent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_49-p2_c\"></a>(c)     A two-year term is also proportionate when viewed against the length of the marriage, which spanned approximately 15 years. Courts have generally regarded short-term maintenance within such a context as fair and reasonable: <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [55].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Maintenance amount</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     I shall now turn to the next issue – the appropriate quantum of spousal maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Having considered the evidence, I find the Wife’s reasonable monthly expenses to be approximately <b>$3,800</b>. In arriving at this figure, I have excluded several items from her stated list of expenses on the basis that these are more appropriately met from her existing personal funds. The amount of $3,800 comprises her share of household expenses, transport costs, and basic personal needs such as toiletries: see <b><u>Annex B-1</u></b> and <b><u>Annex B-2</u></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Wife’s estimated earning capacity should be sufficient to meet these expenses over time: see [43] above. However, in the interim, a short-term maintenance award is warranted to provide financial stability while she re-establishes her income stream.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Husband can afford</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     In my view, the Husband has the financial means to provide the Wife with monthly maintenance of $3,800.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Based on his tax returns,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> the Husband’s average monthly income (after tax but before CPF deduction) from Company A is $30,364.20.

I urge you to have more confidence in your abilities. The evidence clearly shows that you can understand and read English.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_44\" id=\"Ftn_44_1\"><sup>[note: 44]</sup></a></span> You have also previously drawn a strong income in Hong Kong. With determination and perseverance, I am confident that you will be able to secure suitable employment in Singapore. I encourage you to have confidence in your abilities and to take active steps toward financial independence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_b\"></a>(b)     You may also have concerns about how your son will adjust to you becoming a working mother. Such concerns are natural. However, children are generally resilient, especially when they are supported by loving and consistent parenting. You can contribute to his development – not only by being present, but also by modelling the values of perseverance and responsibility through your own actions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"\"></a> <em>To the Husband</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Divorce inevitably entails disruption and adjustment for all parties. Your former wife faces the difficult challenge of transitioning from a stay-home mother to a working parent. Your son, in turn, must adapt to having less time and attention from his primary caregiver.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_61-p2_d\"></a>(d)     These transitional challenges can be softened if both parents adopt a cooperative and equitable approach to post-divorce parenting. As the financially stronger party, your willingness to support your former wife through this limited period of spousal maintenance can make a significant difference. The maintenance ordered is not indefinite – it is a temporary, transitional measure aimed at enabling her to regain financial independence and ensuring continuity and stability for your son during this sensitive period. I hope you can view it not as a burden, but as part of a broader, shared commitment to your child’s well-being and long-term adjustment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a>_____________________________</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"right\"> <b><u>ANNEX A</u></b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>INTERIM ORDER</b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"center\"> <b>ENTERED ON 28 NOVEMBER 2024</b> </div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Orders Made:</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">By Consent,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">1.     <em>In the interim pending the resolution of the issue of spousal and child maintenance in FC/D 3029/2024</em>, and <em>without prejudice to either party's litigated positions</em>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    As and when directed by the service provider, the Plaintiff will make direct payment for the school fees (which is presently about SGD 3,500/month pro rata) and school related expenses (being the school bus and school mandated activities) for the child of the marriage, <b>XXX</b> (NRIC No.: YYY) (“<b>the Child</b>&quot;) and car leasing expenses for the car bearing registration number ZZZ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    Notwithstanding the above paragraph, if the Plaintiff is able to find someone to take over the existing car lease, he shall be at liberty to do so.

Months before his most recent birthday, he penetrated the vagina of his then-10-year-old sister with a pencil. He admitted to three further acts against her: once penetrating her vagina with his finger and twice committing other acts of indecency with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       For the act of penetration with a pencil, the youth was found guilty of a charge of sexually penetrating a minor within s 376A(1) of the Penal Code 1871 (2020 Rev Ed). For the other three acts, each of which constituted an offence within the Penal Code or the Children and Young Persons Act 1993 (2020 Rev Ed) (the “CYPA”), the youth consented to having them taken into consideration in the formulation of the dispositional orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Upon this finding of guilty, the Prosecution urged me to immediately commit the youth to a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (a “JRC”) for 36 months and objected to any assessment of his suitability for any other order. It submitted that he had preyed on a young and vulnerable victim and had while doing so understood the wrongfulness of his acts. It added that the gravity of the offence meant that “the most appropriate punishment is the maximum term of detention in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre as that would best give effect to the principles of deterrence and retribution while serving the aims of rehabilitation.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The power of the Youth Court to seek an assessment of the suitability of an offender for different dispositional orders is found in s 47 of the CYPA. Thereunder, it may obtain “information” on the background and state of development of the youth to equip it to formulate orders that are in the best interests of that youth: s 47(9) of the CYPA. To do so, it calls for a report of “a probation officer, an approved welfare officer, a registered medical practitioner or any other person whom the Youth Court thinks fit to provide a report on the child or young person”: s 47(10) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       I found it premature to immediately commit the youth to a JRC for 36 months purely because he had committed a grave offence. Such a term would have been the maximum that I could have imposed: s 49(1)(i) of the CYPA. But the paramount consideration in these proceedings was not the gravity of his offence but his welfare and best interests: s 4(b) of the CYPA. Determining this welfare and best interests “would depend on his prospects of rehabilitation under the different sentencing options”: <em>WLK v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29618-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 22</a> at [10]. To facilitate this determination, I called for a report of an investigating probation officer, who would in preparing that report collate information on the family background, general conduct, home surroundings, school record, medical history and state of development of the youth: s 49(10) of the CYPA. This determination would then be enriched by the insights of two advisers from a panel of advisers appointed by the President whose roles were to “inform and advise” the Youth Court when a report had been prepared in respect of a youth: s 38(1) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Mr Adriel Tham, an investigating probation officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development, prepared that report. Mr Tham assessed that the youth had anti-social proclivities that, if left unaddressed, would likely lead to further offending. These proclivities included theft, underage smoking, physical aggression, and incestuous behaviour. Exacerbating these proclivities was his general defiance of authority and his inability to abide by structure or routine. Worse, his mother, who was his primary caregiver, lacked the capacity to supervise him. In these circumstances, Mr Tham concluded that the rehabilitation of the youth was best served by committing him to a JRC for 24 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The Prosecution did not disagree with the assessment of Mr Tham that a 24-month placement in a JRC would conduce to the rehabilitation of the youth. But it maintained that the gravity of the offence had been committed justified a 36-month placement in a JRC. It argued that even as rehabilitation was a key focus of the Youth Court, this focus &quot;can be diminished or eclipsed by considerations of deterrence or retribution where the circumstances warrant&quot;. It urged me to give effect to such deterrence and retribution by imposing the &quot;maximum term of detention&quot; in a JRC because the offence involved &quot;predatory behaviour <em>vis-à-vis</em> vulnerable victims&quot;.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The parents of the youth admitted that they had struggled and would struggle to supervise him in the community. They therefore accepted that it was in his best interests to place him in a JRC. Nevertheless, they asked that this placement be limited than 24 months, within which time they hoped that he would change for the better. Unusually, they also asked to have his younger sister, who was the victim in the offence that was the subject of these proceedings, attend in court to watch the pronouncement of any dispositional orders in respect of the youth. They explained that this would allow her to see that justice had been done and facilitate her recovery from his acts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       I declined this request. There was no evidence that witnessing the pronouncement of dispositional orders for of the youth would facilitate his sister’s recovery from his offence. His sister was barely 11 years of age. It was doubtful that she possessed the maturity to understand these proceedings. Indeed, she did not even appear to have understood the significance of the act that was the subject of the offence. Her participation in these proceedings would be of scarce benefit to her. This would not conduce to her welfare or best interests. In any event, my focus in these proceedings was the welfare of the youth and not that of his sister. That welfare would not be furthered by publicising the proceedings in which dispositional orders were made for the youth, even if the publication was only to the extent of his sister. Citing s 46(1) of the CYPA, Amy Tung DJ in <em>Public Prosecutor v GFM (a minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29557-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGYC 4</a> observed that the law strives to insulate from stigmatisation youth offenders dealt with in the Youth Court (at [50]). In a related vein, s 10 of the Family Justice Act 2014 (2020 Rev Ed) provides requires that all matters and proceedings in a Family Justice Court, which includes a Youth Court, “must be heard in private”. Incongruous it would have therefore been to publicise these proceedings simply for a non-party to realise some benefit from watching the pronouncement of the youth’s deserts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Returning to the dispositional orders for the youth, everyone agreed that a stint in a JRC would promote his welfare and best interests. I had the same view. The youth struggled with behavioural issues that made impracticable his rehabilitation in the community. He had, since 2018, been placed on care and protection orders because of the harms that he presented to himself and others as well as the inability of his family to care for him. The most recent of these orders was made in December 2024 in the wake of his commission of the offence that was the subject of these proceedings. This order committed him to the place of safety that was the Singapore Boys’ Hostel pending investigations into that offence. There, he defied the staff, broke security features including locks, and fought with the other residents. He was then transferred to the Singapore Boys’ Home, which was at once a place of safety and a JRC, initially for his care and protection and subsequently on remand pending the resolution of these proceedings. There, he defied the staff, damaged the items that he had been issued, defaced the common property, and used abusive language on the other residents. These events suggested that it could be challenging to rehabilitate him even within a closed and structured environment like that of a place of safety. This left little optimism about his prospects for rehabilitation under such community-based dispositional orders as a probation order and necessitated his placement in a JRC.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     As for the duration of that JRC placement, I returned once again to the CYPA, which was the legislative framework that governed these proceedings. As the Prosecution highlighted, the offence that the youth had committed was amongst the gravest of all sexual offences. Had he been an adult, any concern for his rehabilitation would likely have been eclipsed by the public interest in retribution and general deterrence that would attract a stiff sentence of incarceration, as the Court of Appeal observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v CPS</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32701-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 2 SLR 749</a> at [29]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">29    … rehabilitation will be readily displaced as the predominant sentencing consideration in the case of serious offences. It is also clear that serious cases of rape, such as that in <em>Hafiz</em> ([20] <em>supra</em>), involve such outrageous offending behaviour that rehabilitation has to be subordinated to a more serious form of corrective punishment (<em>Al-Ansari</em> at [35]). What the current jurisprudence does not prescribe (rightly so, in our view) is a rigid rule for cases of rape which do not immediately fall in the uppermost category of severity. The court is instead called upon to undertake judgment on a case-by-case basis to determine whether rehabilitation retains its primacy in the sentencing calculus, which involves close scrutiny of the specific circumstances of the offence and the offender. In doing so, a broad heuristic offered by this court in <em>Mohd Noran</em> ([18] <em>supra</em>) is that as a general rule, neither probation nor RT is suitable in cases of rape (at [3]), and that where an offender is of mature age and understanding, a custodial sentence should be imposed in the absence of exceptional circumstances (at [2]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Still, the youth was not an adult. Rather, he was little more than a child. The law therefore <em>mandated</em> that he was charged with and tried for his offence by the Youth Court: s 39(1) of the CYPA. Here, the paramount consideration was the welfare and best interests of the child or young person before the court: s 4(b) of the CYPA; see also <em>WLK</em> at [10]. This consideration enjoined me to focus on the rehabilitation of the youth by formulating dispositional orders that addressed the causes of his offending and steered him towards productive pursuits. Indeed, the public interest lay in this focus on rehabilitation in the light of the characteristic impulsiveness of the youth’s adolescent decision-making and the benefit to society from his reform given the years that he had ahead of him: <em>A Karthik v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/22640-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 5 SLR 1289</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     I found wisdom in the recommendation of Mr Tham, the investigating probation officer, to place the youth in a JRC for 24 months. As Mr Tham explained, this period would comprise 12 months of rehabilitation programs followed by 12 months of reintegration programs. During the first 12 months, the youth would undergo three months of assessments to determine the risks that had to be addressed and his capacity for education. The next nine months would equip the youth with offence-specific skills to manage the causes of his offending, general skills to function productively in society, and habits and routines that conduce to independent living. This would be followed by 12 months of reintegrative programs, which could include the milestones of day release and home leave, for the youth to practice independent living in the community with those skills. An excellent description of these reintegration programs and the year-long post-care support for a resident of a JRC is found in Lim Hui Min, <em>Juvenile Justice in Singapore: Rehabilitation, Reintegration, Restoration</em> (Academy Publishing, 2023) at paras 7.33–7.39:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.33  Residents can aim to achieve certain milestones. The milestones are progressive, in that if the resident does well at each milestone, he or she can be considered for the next one. These eventually lead the placement on reintegration programmes and trials in the community. meaning that the resident can spend time outside the Home, in school or at work, or in his or her own home. This system gives the residents ownership over their rehabilitation by giving them goals to aim for, which lead to family and community reintegration and a restoration to ordinary life outside the youth justice system. …</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.34  Home leave is a reintegration programme to allow residents to build bonds with family members and prepare them for living in a family setting. During home leave, the residents can go back home to see their families over the weekend while observing a curfew which is usually from 10.00pm to 6.00am. Their friends can also come over to see them, and they can go out to see their friends. Before the residents are allowed to go on home leave, the caseworker will discuss with them and their families what ground rules should be set for this period (for example, when they are allowed to be out with their friends, how far ahead of time they should let their parents know that they are going out, what chores they are expected to help out in at home), and ways that the family can spend time together (for example by watching TV and having a meal together).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.35  If the residents do well in the Home and have completed the various programmes in their individual care plans, they can go on to the Day Release Scheme. This Scheme allows residents to leave the Home in the day to pursue their studies or employment outside the Home and return to the Home after school or work. On weekends, the resident can be granted home leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.36  Before going out into the community, the resident would have been taught self-management skills such as emotional regulation, rational thinking, budgeting, time management and self-control. The caseworker and Youth Guidance Officer will also address critical areas with the resident such as how to manage temptation (<em>eg</em>, the temptation to take drugs, drink alcohol, break curfew, commit offences), and problem-solving, for example resolving conflict with peers without resorting to fighting, or saving no to friends who are a bad influence For example, the resident can be asked to do a role-play where the Youth Guidance Officer plays a friend who asks him to play truant from school. The resident will practise responding, and will be given tips on how to respond in the right way, and also to think of the consequences of whatever decision he might take, for example to think about who he would let down by skipping school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.37  The idea of the Day Release Scheme, which the resident can be on after achieving a diamond banding, is to support the residents progress towards discharge and eventual integration back into the family and society. If the resident does well on the Day Release Scheme, he or she can be considered for the Readiness for Community and Home Scheme provided there is a stable and conducive living arrangement for him or her, with adequate adult supervision. Under this Scheme, residents can return to their own homes full-time, though they would have to observe a curfew. They would still have to meet with their caseworkers, and show good progress at school or work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.38  Whenever necessary, psychologists from the Clinical and Forensic Psychology Service of the MSF will provide a specialised risk assessment to examine specific risks or mental health issues that the resident may have. This may provide additional information to that contributed by the resident's multi-disciplinary team to determine the resident's suitability to be placed on the Day Release Scheme and the Readiness for Community and Home Scheme.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">7.39  There is a post-care support service for residents discharged from [a JRC], which lasts for a year. The purpose is to help the youths re-integrate into the community, and sustain the skills they learnt and the good habits they formed during the time of their orders. The service starts six months prior to the resident's discharge. During this time, the post-care worker (from an appointed social service agency) builds rapport with the resident and his or her family. Upon the resident's discharge, the post-care worker continues to work with him or her for one year. The frequency of interactions is tailored to the individual risks and needs of the youth. The post-care worker will give the youth and his or her family support and encouragement, link the youth to schools, employers, and interest groups, or community resources for financial or social service needs, and help him manage and resolve any difficulties early.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Prosecution submitted that, even apart from retribution and deterrence, a 36-month placement in the Singapore Boys’ Home was justified because it would benefit the youth, who had struggled to adapt to its structure while remanded there during these proceedings. It argued that notwithstanding Mr Tham’s recommendation of a 24-month placement, a 36-month placement would provide more time for the rehabilitation and the reintegration programs there to operate. But a longer placement in a JRC should not be imposed if a shorter placement there will secure the rehabilitation of a young offender. The Youth Court seeks to act with parsimony in that it will avoid imposing severe orders and onerous conditions where less severe and onerous ones will sufficiently rehabilitate the offender. I reproduce the observations of Sundaresh Menon CJ in <em>M Raveendran v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27671-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 3 SLR 1183</a> at [55]–[56] endorsing the application of judicial parsimony in the Youth Court:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">55    For completeness, I should state that the rejection of the parsimony principle as a general sentencing principle does not mean that it should not, in limited and appropriate circumstances, be applied. An example is where an accused is a young offender as was observed in <em>Public Prosecutor v ATW (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGJC 0002.xml')\">[2011] SGJC 2</a> at [3]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>Fundamental Considerations</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The Juvenile Court seeks to act with judicious parsimony with juveniles in that it [does not seek] to impose severe orders and onerous conditions where less severe and onerous ones are sufficient. Since this is so, and to pursue rehabilitation and restoration, probation is generally the preferred option.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">56    It must, nevertheless, be reiterated that the principle does not apply whenever the accused person is a young offender. Due regard must be had to whether the circumstances personal to the accused in question call for a less intrusive punishment to be imposed. I respectfully consider that this was correctly articulated in <em>Public Prosecutor v GCB (A Minor)</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22932-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGYC 1</a> as follows (at [3]–[4]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\"> <b>General Principles</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3    The Youth Court … focuses primarily on finding rehabilitative measures and solutions that are most workable for the juvenile, given the facts and circumstances of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">4    Such an approach cannot mean that a less intrusive or less severe option such as probation is always chosen, as though every juvenile would be entitled to it by virtue of his youthfulness. The court may generally prefer a parsimonious approach, favouring less intrusive and less severe options wherever possible.[*] But it has ultimately to ensure that the order chosen would be one that best serves the interests of the young offender before it. More rigorous orders will have to be imposed where they are needed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">…</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[* footnote 3] I am aware of what has been expressed in <em>Than Stenly Granida Purwanto v PP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22402-M.xml')\">[2003] SGHC 200</a> limiting application of the principle of parsimony. The pronouncements, however, were in the context of dealing with adult offenders, not juveniles</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphases removed]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     By the time of these dispositional orders, the youth had spent over three months under care and protection and/or in remand in the Singapore Boys’ Home. This period should have accustomed him, even if imperfectly, to the environment there. Taking account of the assessment of Mr Tham, I found that a further stint there of 24 months would best serve the welfare and interests of the youth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     For completeness, in <em>CPS</em>, the offender who was 16 years of age at the time of his offence of rape was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. The Court of Appeal found that the gravity of the offence alone had displaced the presumptive focus on rehabilitation that arose from the youth of the offender in favour of the public interest in retribution and deterrence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     Here, the youth was not far in age from the offender in <em>CPS</em>. Nor was his offence overly dissimilar in gravity to that of the offender in <em>CPS</em>. Nevertheless, that difference in age between the youth and the offender in <em>CPS</em>, even if it was only a year or two, was not immaterial. Because the youth had yet to attain 16 years of age on the date of commencement of the hearing of his charge, the law mandated that he had to be tried for his offence by and only by the Youth Court: s 39(1) and (6) of the CYPA. In doing so, s 4(b) of the CYPA required the Youth Court to have as its paramount consideration the welfare and best interests of the youth, which consideration fell to be determined by reference to his prospects of rehabilitation: <em>WLK</em> at [10]. The gravity of the offence, and the considerations of retribution and deterrence that the common law had found a heinous sexual offence to implicate, had to operate within this legislative framework.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Accordingly, I committed the youth to the JRC of the Singapore Boys’ Home for a period of 24 months forthwith.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I record my appreciation Dr Vivien Huan and Mr Muhammad Dzulkifly, the advisers whom with me constituted the Youth Court in these proceedings pursuant to s 38(1) of the CYPA, for their service and advice.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Children and Young Persons Act – Care and Protection Orders"],"date":"2025-06-19","court":"Youth Court","case-number":"Youth Court Appeal YA-0002-2025-01, Case No. CPO 000034-2022","title":"Father of XGK v Child Protector","citation":"[2025] SGYC 3","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33556-SSP.xml","counsel":["Child Protector in person","Parent in person"],"timestamp":"2025-07-25T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Wendy Yu","html":"<root><head><title>Father of XGK v Child Protector</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> Father of XGK <em>v</em> Child Protector </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33556-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGYC 3</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Youth Court Appeal YA-0002-2025-01, Case No. CPO 000034-2022</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">19 June 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Youth Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Wendy Yu </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Child Protector in person; Parent in person </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Father of XGK — Child Protector </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Children and Young Persons Act</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Care and Protection Orders</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">19 June 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> District Judge Wendy Yu:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       This appeal is brought by the Father, Mr B (“the Father”) of the child XGK, female, born on 27 July 2009 (“the Child”) against the final orders made on 19 June 2025 pursuant to an application brought by Child Protective Service (“CPS”), Ministry of Social and Family Development, Singapore (“MSF”) under Section 54 of the Children and Young Persons Act, Cap 38 (“CYPA”) for a review of an existing care and protection order (“the Application”). The mother of the Child, Mdm C (“the Mother”), had expressed her agreement in Court on 17 April 2025 to the making of orders as per the recommendations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The orders that I have made on 19 June 2025 (“the Final Orders”) are set out as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(1)    [The Child] is to be placed under the supervision of an Approved Welfare Officer, under the care of Mr D and Mdm E, for a period of 6 months, with effect from 19 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    [The Father] is to comply with the following conditions, under section 54(8) of the CYPA:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)    (a) [The Child’s] contacts with [The Father] and any significant others to be subject to the approval and review of the Approved Welfare Officer;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    [The Father] is not to do any act that will compromise the safety and well-being of [the Child];</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    [The Father] shall not publish or broadcast, through any means including on social media or the Internet, anything which directly or indirectly relates to or is the subject of the proceedings before the Youth Court;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    [The Child], [the Father] and any significant others to attend and participate in individual interviews, discuss safety plans and caregiving arrangements with the Approved Welfare Officer to ensure the safety and well-being of [the Child].</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    Professionals to release the medical, psychological, counselling and/or relevant reports of [the Child] and [the Father] to the Approved Welfare Officer.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    [The Father] and [the Child] are to be required to undergo any counselling/psychotherapy/assessment/programme/treatment as deemed necessary by the Approved Welfare Officer, and [the Father] shall execute a bond of $1,000.00 to comply with the order under Section 60(2), in accordance with Section 60(5) of the CYPA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       I will now set out the grounds for the Final Orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       CPS first took out an application on 4 December 2022, for a care and protection order after invoking Section 11(1) of the CYPA. The basis of their application was on Section 5(1)(d)(i) and Section 5(1)(f)(i) of the CYPA, that the Child has been, or is at risk of being ill-treated by the Father and that the Child behaves in a manner that is, or is likely to be, harmful to herself and the Father is unwilling to take necessary measures to remedy the situation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Social Report hearing was fixed on 9 May 2022, and CPS had recommended for, <em>inter alia</em>, an order for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely her paternal grandparents, Mr D and Mdm E (“the paternal grandparents”), for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months. Besides the grounds set out in paragraph 4 above, CPS had added an additional ground in the social report, under Section 5(1)(g), that the Child was likely to suffer from emotional harm due to emotional or psychological abuse by the Father. The Mother had agreed to CPS’s recommendations on 5 May 2022. The Father disagreed with the recommendations and so the Court had fixed the matter for a Family Conference to allow a Family Court Specialist to facilitate the conversation between CPS and the Father and to address the Father’s concerns. After the Family Conference on 31 May 2022, the matter was resolved as CPS and the Father agreed for the Child to be placed under a statutory supervision order, under the care of the paternal grandparents for a period of 12 months, with a review in 6 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       At the review hearing on 30 December 2022, CPS had recommended for the Child to be committed to the care of the Fit Persons, namely, the paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months as they were of the view that the Child continues to be in need of care and protection. The Father contested the recommendations. The matter was fixed for hearing on 6 July 2023 before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       After hearing the matter on 6 July 2023, I had directed for a child interview on 4 August 2023 to be arranged for me to speak to the Child to ascertain her views. The Child was 14 years old then and would be mature enough to express her views about her living arrangements and her relationship with her Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       After considering the Child’s views at the interview (which remained confidential) and the parties’ submissions, I had ordered, on 30 August 2023, for the Child to be placed under the statutory supervision of the Approved Welfare Officer, under the care of her paternal grandparents, for a period of 12 months (“the August 2023 orders”). I had also expressed to parties at the hearing that the August 2023 orders will give time for professionals to help mend the Father-daughter relationship and that CPS should work with the Father towards the ultimate goal of reintegration to the Father, as the Father continues to receive services from the professionals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Current Application for Review and CPS’s position</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       CPS had subsequently requested for a review hearing on 30 August 2024 (“the Review Hearing”). The Child had turned 15 years old. CPS had recommended for the current order for statutory supervision to be extended for another 12 months. The matter was fixed for a contested hearing on 13 November 2024 (“the 13 November Hearing”) before me as the Father had objected to the recommendations. The Mother did not attend the 13 November Hearing as she had given her consent to the recommendations on 16 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     For the 13 November Hearing, CPS had filed 2 affidavits, namely, the Affidavit of CPO Mr F dated 4 October 2024 and the Affidavit of CPO Ms G dated 30 October 2024. CPS had also filed their submissions dated 6 November 2024. The Father had filed 2 affidavits dated 11 September 2024 and 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">CPS’s Position at 13 November Hearing</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     CPS had submitted<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> that there has been no material change in circumstances since the August 2023 orders and that the Child remains in need of care and protection under section 5(1)(g) read with sections 5(2)(a) of the CYPA. CPS is of the view that the Child has suffered and continues to be likely to suffer from emotional harm because she has been subjected to emotional and psychological abuse by the Father, as the Father has subjected the Child to persistent acts of rejection or degradation that are harmful to her well-being or sense of self-worth.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     CPS had contended that there remains a significant risk that the Father may subject the Child to further acts of emotional or psychological abuse if she is returned to his care at this stage<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, which is shown by the Father’s confrontational behaviour during the access sessions between the Child and him, as well as the Father’s persistent acts of exposing the Child’s identity online.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     CPS has informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> the Court that two of the six access sessions (on 27 February 2024 and 26 March 2024) had to be terminated early at the Child’s request. CPS has added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> that since the August 2023 orders, the Father had persistently compromised the Child’s well-being by revealing her identity as being subject of CPS’s investigations and of previous care and protection orders, both online and in public<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span>. In particular, the Father had recorded the six access sessions between January and March 2024 without permission and uploaded them on YouTube and/or his website and uploaded a full, unredacted copy of his affidavit filed in previous Youth Court proceedings which contained various references to the Child’s name. The Father had contravened Section 111 of the CYPA by recording and uploading photos of his access sessions with the Child onto social media platforms and was given a 24-months conditional warning by the Police<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     According to CPS, the Child’s “emotions became very unstable, and that she felt nauseous and experienced chest tightness, after [the Child] had learnt of [the Father’s] uploading of videos.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> On 25 August 2024, it was also brought to CPS’s attention that the Father had uploaded online screenshots of text messages exchange with CPS. The Child could be identified in these messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Father’s position at the Hearing on 13 November 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father objected to the recommendations at the 13 November hearing. The Father alleges<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> that he had “discovered corrupt practices (unmerited/excessive referrals to Social Service Agencies (SSAs) by CPS and bribery arrangements between them, enabled and protected by the Family Justice Courts)”. The Father argues<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> that CPS did not adhere to the principles of the CYPA with a “corrupt intent” so that the Child Protection Order in this matter could be “extended for as long as possible to generate fraudulent counselling fees”. The Father contends that CPS “did nothing to facilitate the reintegration process with a ‘corrupt intent’ to generate fraudulent counselling fees (paid by public monies) for SSAs”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Father contends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> that the existing child protection order was “voided” on 13 March 2024 because CPS “did nothing” to facilitate the reintegration process when the Child agreed to move in and live with him during the access session on 12 March 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Father had submitted at the 13 November Hearing<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> that the existing orders must be discharged and that the Child must return to live with him immediately. The Father had informed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> the Court that he had moved from a 1-room rental flat in Choa Chu Kang to a 3-room flat in Bukit Batok which means he is able to provide a more stable and comfortable home environment for the Child. The Father has stated that the Child’s paternal grandparents currently live in a “short-lease 2 room Flexi flat” where the Child does not have her own room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     When the Court asked the Father at the 13 November Hearing whether he had removed the online content identifying the Child as someone being involved in these Child Protection Proceedings (as directed by the Court by DJ Amy Tung at the Review Hearing), the Father had informed the Court that he did not intend to remove the online content.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     After hearing both parties, I had then passed interim orders and directed CPS to arrange for the Child to undergo psychological and/or psychiatric assessment by the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and for IMH to furnish a copy of the report to the Court and Parents before the next hearing, so as to ascertain the current mental and/or emotional state of the Child to decide what were the orders that should be made that would be in her best interest.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     The Father had filed an appeal against my interim orders made 13 November 2023. The appeal has been dismissed on 18 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Developments since 13 November 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     There were two medical reports dated 21 January 2025 and 5 February 2025 furnished by Dr H (“Dr H”) from the Child Guidance Clinic (“the Medical Reports”). In the first report dated 21 January 2025, Dr H has reported that [the Child] shares a good relationship with her mother, while [the Child] has expressed<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> to him that she “did not wish to visit [her Father] as ‘he would never change’. Moving forward, Dr H had recommended that supervised sessions with [the Father] at a neutral setting with a trusted therapist should be arranged so that [the Father] can still have some regular interaction with her. Dr H had also added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> that such arrangement should only take place when [the Child] is ready and agreeable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     In a further report by Dr H dated 5 February 2025, he added<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> that “it will be likely that having to stay with her father and depart from the living arrangement [the Child] has been used to, will adversely affect her emotional and mental well-being. Dr H had also highlighted that [the Child] will be taking her national examinations at the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Further Hearings on 20 February 2025, 17 April 2025, 28 May 2025 and 19 June 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     At the hearing on 20 February 2025, parties had informed me that the appeal against the interim orders made on 13 November 2024 were to be heard on 18 March 2025. I had adjourned the hearing to 17 April 2025 to wait for the outcome of the appeal. However, as I had the benefit of considering the contents of the Medical Reports by then, I was of the view that it would be in the interest of the Child for the Court to hear from the Mother at the next hearing, especially when Dr H had reported that the Mother and the Child shared a good relationship. I had therefore directed for arrangements to be made for the Mother to be present at the hearing on 17 April 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Both parents were present at the hearing on 17 April 2025. CPS had maintained their position as stated in their review report, while the Father was of the view that the Child should be returned to him immediately. The Mother, on the other hand, expressed that it was not in the interest of the Child to return to the care of the Father. The Mother also informed the Court that she was seeking legal advice as to whether to apply to the Syariah Court for a variation of the care and control order (which is currently with the Father) back to her. I was of the view that the Mother’s views should be stated on affidavit as this was the first time the Court had a chance to hear her views on the matter. While the issue before this Court is not one of custody care and control, if the Mother decides to file an application to the Syariah Court for a variation of the current care and control orders, it may potentially affect the living arrangements of the Child. I therefore adjourned the hearing to 28 May 2025 to give the Mother a chance to file an affidavit on her views on the matter and to confirm the course that she was intending to take.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     At the hearing on 28 May 2025, the Mother did not turn up for the hearing and also did not file her affidavit as directed. However, CPS had updated the Court on further developments since the previous hearing. CPS had informed the Court that the Father had breached the interim order made on 17 April 2025, by sending emails to various foreign embassies which resulted in the disclosure of the identity of the Child in these proceedings to non-parties. The Father had explained at the hearing that he had done so as he intended to seek political asylum from the foreign embassies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     CPS had then sought the leave of Court to prepare an affidavit to furnish the Court with the contents of such alleged breach of the interim orders on the part of the Father. I had granted leave to CPS to prepare their affidavit- to be filed and served by 4 June 2025. I had also granted leave to the Father to prepare an affidavit (if he wishes to) to explain the alleged breach, before adjourning the hearing to release my decision on 19 June 2025. The Father did not file the affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavit of Ms J, Deputy Director of Protective Service (formerly known as CPS) dated 3 June 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     There were multiple emails (dated 6 May 2025, 19 May 2025, 21 May 2025, 22 May 2025) sent by the Father to CPS, which has also been copied to various foreign embassies, with attachments that disclose the name of the Child, exhibited in the affidavit of Ms J.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Father had, in his emails<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span>, expressed his intention to relocate out of the ASEAN/Commonwealth location to return his Ural- Altaic roots by 2030. The Father’s act of disclosing the Child’s identity to non-parties to the proceedings is in breach of the interim court order that stated that “[the Father] shall not publish or broadcast, through any means including on social media or the Internet, anything which directly or indirectly relates to or is the subject of the proceedings before the Youth Court.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     There was a whatsapp message between the CPO and the Father<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>, that was exhibited in Ms J’s affidavit, with CPO asking the Father on 27 March 2025 if he would like to resume supervised access leading up to the hearing. The Father declined the offer to resume supervised access but had insisted on “reintegration”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Applicable Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In a review of existing care and protection orders, the legal test that is to be applied is as stated at BHR (Natural Mother of B) v Child Protector <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/16760-SSP.xml')\">[2014] SGJC 1</a> (“BHR”) at [15]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“…whether there exist any change in circumstances…to warrant/justify the cancellation/rescission [of the Previous Orders]. In this regard [the Court] will have to consider whether the child is still in need of care and protection under [the relevant sections of the CYPA] given the welfare and best interests of the child as of paramount interest.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     In the unreported decision of the High Court in Youth Court Appeal No. YA 004 of 2018/01<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>, which was an appeal from Child Protector v Parents of GCQ v GCB <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22225-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGYC 4</a> (“GCQ”), Debbie Ong J had opined<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span> that the Court needed to consider at a review hearing “whether the Parents are now in a different position such that they are sufficiently fit to have the children returned to them”. In determining this, the Court could consider whether the parents have complied with counselling and other interventions, whether they are committed to a safety plan, and whether there have been breaches in safety plans.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I was guided by Section 4(b) of the CYPA, which states that “in all matters relating to the administration or application of this Act, the welfare and best interests of the child or young person must be the first and paramount consideration<em>”</em>, in making my final orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Application of Law to the Facts of this Case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I agree with CPS’s submissions that there has been no material change in circumstances since the August 2023 orders, as the Father does not appear to be in a different position such that he is sufficiently fit to have the Child returned to him. In determining this, I have considered that there has been multiple breaches of the interim orders, such as disclosing the identity of the Child to non-parties, and also the Father’s refusal to accept the professional’s attempts to start with supervised access to help ease the Child to have more contact with him. Parent-child relationships are dynamic and a broken relationship will need sufficient time to heal. While the Father is insisting on an immediate discharge of the statutory supervision order, the Father’s recent act of disclosing the Child’s identity in the past month by copying the multiple foreign embassies also persuaded me that the Father still does not seem to have insight currently as to how his conduct would compromise the well-being of the Child. The Child should not be returned to his care until he is sufficiently fit to care for the well-being of the Child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Nevertheless, I am also of the view that the status quo should not remain in the long-term as attempts should be made to heal the relationship between the Father and the Child, to work towards reintegration. I had considered Dr H’s recommendations that it will be helpful to arrange for supervised sessions with the Father at a neutral setting with a trusted therapist so that there could be a rebuilding of relationship between them. Considering the welfare and best interests of the Child as paramount, I extended the statutory supervision order for another 6 months- to offer some stability to the Child as she completes her O level examinations at the end of 2025 and to give the professionals a chance to help re-integrate her back to living with the Father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     The Father must understand that the Child is going to be 16 years old, with a mind of her own, and if he continues to disregard her views or to remain adamant in refusing to work with the professionals to mend this fragile relationship, re-integration will become even more difficult as she grows older. If the Father still refuses the therapeutic sessions to work on helping the Child feel safe at the prospect of living with him, it is to his own detriment and will only delay the re-integration process. The ball is in his court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     For the above reasons, I made the orders as stated at [2] above.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>[14] of CPS’s Written Submissions dated 6 November 2024 (“CPS’s Submissions”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>[19] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>[26] of Mr F’s Affidavit of 4 October 2024 (“BLA”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Page 93 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>[19c] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>[27(g)] of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Page 94 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Page 95 of BLA</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>[3] of Father’s Affidavit dated 11 September 2024 (“FA1”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>[10] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>[12] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>[12] of Father’s Affidavit dated 16 October 2024 (“FA2”)</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>[24] of FA1</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Page 4 of FA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>[16] of Medical Report dated 21 January 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>[19] of Medical Report dated 21 January 2025.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>[2] of Medical Report dated 5 February 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>For example, in the Father’s email of 6 May 2025 to CPS, at page 5 of Ms J’s affidavit</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>At Page 7 of Ms Suen’s Affidavit dated 3 June 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>[13] of CPS’s Submissions</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>Page 11 of the Notes of Argument dated 22 November 2018, at page 50 of CPS’s Bundle of Authorities</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Variation – Whether a father’s retrenchment constitutes a material change in his circumstances that justifies reducing the child maintenance that he has been ordered to pay – Section 118 of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement – Whether a father’s retrenchment is a good reason for contravening a child maintenance order – Section 71 of the Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2025-07-17","court":"Family Court","case-number":"FC/OADV 105 of 2024 (Variation);

It raises several interesting issues regarding the issue of fairness. For instance, should the request be allowed on the sole basis that he had been retrenched? Is he expected to liquidate his assets so as to continue paying the agreed maintenance? What are the dominant considerations in determining whether to reduce the agreed maintenance?</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the background facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In November 2015, the Father consented to a court order which stipulated that he was to make the following payments for the maintenance of his daughter (D.O.B. xxx 2005) and son (D.O.B. xxx 2008): (“<b>Maintenance Order</b>”).</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.78%\"><col width=\"50.84%\"><col width=\"40.38%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Age of the child</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Maintenance amount</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Between 12 to 17 years (inclusive)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">€1,100/month</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">From 18 years until the child turns 21 or gains employment, whichever is later</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">€1,200/month</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In May 2024, the Father was retrenched. Prior to this event, he had been paying €2,300/month as child maintenance (combined).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_c\"></a>(c)     From June 2024, the Father began paying €1,150/month as child maintenance (combined).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In October 2024, the Mother sought a court order to compel the Father to comply with the Maintenance Order and to pay €2,300/month in child maintenance: MSS 2292/2024 (“<b>Enforcement Application</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_e\"></a>(e)     About one month later, the Father applied to reduce the child maintenance to €800/month for both children (combined) starting from June 2024, arguing that his retrenchment was a material change in circumstances. He further applied for the maintenance payments which he had made in excess of €800/month since June 2024 to be used to offset his future maintenance payments: FC/OADV 105/2024 (“<b>Variation Application</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_2-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Mother opposed the Variation Application. She contended that the Father had the financial means to comply with the Maintenance Order and that she did not have sufficient resources to make up for the shortfall if the maintenance is reduced.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Variation Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicable principles</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       Before turning to the merits of the parties’ applications, I will set out the principles governing the variation of child maintenance orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Material change in the circumstances</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Father’s application is based on s 118 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court <em>may</em> at any time vary ... any subsisting order for maintenance, whether secured or unsecured, on the application ... of the person against whom the order was made ... where there has been any <em>material change in the circumstances</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       It is important to note that the retrenchment of a paying parent <em>per se</em> does not automatically justify a variation of a maintenance order. This is because s 118 confers a discretion on the court – it “<em>may</em>” vary the order, but is not obliged to do so. To persuade a court to vary a maintenance order, the paying parent must prove three things. <em>First</em>, there has been a change in the circumstances (<b>Requirement 1</b>). <em>Second</em>, the change has occurred <em>after</em> the maintenance order was made (<b>Requirement 2</b>). <em>Third</em>, the change is of such a nature that makes it necessary to vary the order (<b>Requirement 3</b>): <em>BZD v BZE</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/24080-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGCA 1</a> (“<b><em>BZD</em></b>”) at [10] and [14].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Is it unfair for the paying parent to comply with the maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       In general, Requirements 1 and 2 do not raise any issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Requirement 3 requires some elaboration. To satisfy this requirement, a paying parent must show that because of his/her loss of employment, “it is no longer fair” for him/her to provide maintenance order as originally ordered by the court: <em>BZD</em> at [14]; <em>ATS v ATT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19435-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGHC 196</a> at [12]. In assessing whether the paying parent has met this requirement, the potential hardship to him/her is not the sole consideration. This is because the principle of fairness requires the court to also consider two interests of two other persons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the interests of the child. A reduction in the paying parent’s maintenance obligation must not prejudice the child’s welfare – which remains the paramount concern.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, the interests of the other parent. It follows from [7(a)] that the resultant shortfall in maintenance will often have to be borne by the other parent. It is contrary to the principle of fairness if the paying parent is permitted to reduce his/her maintenance obligation by causing the other parent to suffer undue hardship in having to cover the shortfall. Ultimately, a court must ensure a fair and realistic division of the maintenance obligation between the parents with due regard to their respective means and circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       What matters should a court consider when balancing the various interests so as to arrive at a fair outcome? In my view, these include the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that the loss of employment is sudden/unexpected?</em> It is settled law that whether a change in the circumstances is foreseeable is a relevant consideration: <em>BZD</em> at [15]. One example of a foreseeable loss of employment is where a paying parent, who was on probation when the maintenance order was made, is subsequently not confirmed as an employee: see e.g., <em>TXC v TXD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/19946-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGFC 12</a> at [51] to [54].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that the loss of employment is not self-induced?</em> Courts are slow to allow a variation application if the loss of employment is self-induced: see e.g., <em>CDV v CDW</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25381-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 1427</a> at [88]; <em>TBC v TBD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17192-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGFC 27</a> at [18].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Following from this, a paying parent should provide the reason for his/her loss of employment. If a paying parent fails to do so, then his/her variation application is unlikely to succeed: see, e.g., <em>VBP v VBQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23729-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 116</a> at [22] to [24]. (Although this case concerns an application to rescind a maintenance order, the approach adopted there is equally applicable to variation applications.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       A paying parent will not be allowed to avoid or minimise his/her maintenance obligation by voluntarily resigning or causing his/her own termination from employment: <em>UNC v UND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/22031-SSP.xml')\">[2018] SGFC 62</a> (“<b><em>UNC</em></b>”) at [24(a)]. This principle is illustrated in <em>UWY v UWZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23246-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGFC 60</a> (“<b><em>UWY</em></b>”). In that case, the variation application was denied because the paying parent had resigned to become a self-employed in his own start-up: at [25] and [32].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Has the paying parent shown that he/she is unable to pay the child maintenance?</em> This requires a court to consider the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, has the paying parent provided evidence of his/her financial resources?

This is incorrect. The mortgage loan is tied to his Canberra Drive apartment. This apartment is valued at approximately $1.42 million.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> After deducting the mortgage, the apartment has a net value of around $1 million. In other words, the Father has a net <em>surplus</em> of assets: see [16] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father’s claim that he cannot afford to pay child maintenance of €2,300/month (approximately $3,416/month<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>) does not gel with the fact that he could afford to spend $121,424 to purchase the Philippines property. He was aware of his impending retrenchment as early as 2 April 2024 – well before he made full payment for the Philippines property. If there had been a genuine concern about his financial situation at the material time, he could have opted to forego the purchase. During the hearing on 2 July 2025, his counsel confirmed that backing out of the purchase would have cost the Father only $2,248 in forfeited reservation fees.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Mother submitted that it is inconceivable for the Father to have only $385,142.53 in savings, and that he must have undisclosed assets. These submissions are based on the following.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)       In 2013/2014, he held assets amounting to €437,243. Of this sum, €148,000 were paid to the Mother pursuant to the ancillary matters order, leaving a balance of €289,243. The Mother contended that this balance had not been accounted for.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       The Father was employed for nearly a decade after the ancillary matters order and had earned substantial income during that time. In 2012, he had received a stock incentive valued at USD23,000. The Mother argued that he would likely have received further incentives before his retrenchment in 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> His tax returns for the years of assessment 2022 and 2024 reflected a total income of $1,194,152.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_18-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father also held investments that generate approximately $4,200/month in dividends from two funds AAA and BBB.

He is 56 years old – well below the statutory retirement age. He has considerable professional experience, having served as the General Manager (Asia) of a multinational corporation in the medical devices sector. He has also taken steps to become self-employed. In this regard, he had earned $5,759.86 in consultancy fees in January and May 2025,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span> and is actively exploring additional consultancy opportunities in Germany.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> In my view, it is a matter of time before the Father resumes employment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In the interim, the Father will have to take active steps to manage his personal expenses. I make two observations in this regard:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, it is unclear what the “Maintenance” item of $1,642/month refers to.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> No explanation or supporting evidence has been provided to justify this amount.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_20-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, after excluding the expense item relating to “Maintenance” and the children, the Father’s personal monthly expenses amount to $9,595: see <b><u>Annex A</u></b>.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> This sum appears disproportionately high for a single who is unemployed.

I find that he has also failed to discharge his burden of proof on this issue. Let me begin by summarising his position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Father’s submissions</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The Father submitted that it is reasonable for the Mother to bear the shortfall in maintenance if his Variation Application is granted. This submission is based on the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He estimated the combined expenses for both children to be only about €1,480/month – and not €2,300/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> (See <b><u>Annex B</u></b> for his computations.) This estimate is premised on the children’s cost of living (who now reside in Germany) being lower than in Singapore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When he reduced the maintenance payments to €1,150/month in June 2024 – the Mother began contributing €400/month towards the children’s expenses.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span> The Father argued that if his maintenance payments were reduced to €800/month, the resulting shortfall would be only €280/month – i.e. 1,480/month minus [€800/month + €400/month].<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Father submitted that the Mother can bridge this shortfall (€280/month) by securing better employment.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He added that the financial impact would not be significant on her as she receives rental income, government support, and is eligible for retirement payments from the German government.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I find that it is not fair to require the Mother to bear the shortfall in maintenance. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <u>Maintenance Order was entered by consent.</u> At the outset, I emphasise that the amount in the Maintenance Order is one that the Father had voluntarily consented to. Courts are slow to disturb consent orders without compelling reasons, especially where the agreed maintenance reflects the parties’ understanding of their children's present and future needs: <em>AUA v ATZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19292-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 4 SLR 674</a> at [31] to [33]; <em>UNC</em> at [24(b)] to [24(e)]; <em>WWQ v WWR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/33239-SSP.xml')\">[2025] 3 SLR 1167</a> at [6]; <em>AON v AOO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0926.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 926</a> at [24]; <em>Lee Min Jai v Chua Cheow Koon</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2005] 1 SLR(R) 0548.xml')\">[2005] 1 SLR(R) 548</a> at [5]–[6].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <u>No good reason given for setting aside agreed maintenance</u>. In this case, the Father has failed to prove that €1,480/month is a reasonable amount for the children’s maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_i\"></a>(i)       There are significant gaps in his computation of the children’s expenses. For instance, he had omitted basic and recurring monthly expense items such as utilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       His estimates for the children’s expense items are also unrealistically low. For instance, he had proposed pocket money allowance of only €50/month for both children – i.e. less than one euro/day per child. This is manifestly insufficient as his children are already young adults – 17 and 19 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       The Father contended that older children would incur fewer expenses than when they were younger. Not only does this contention defy logic, it also contradicts the underlying premise of the Maintenance Order that he had consented to.

Specifically, he has failed to prove the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_a\"></a>(a)     That he cannot afford to pay €2,300/month in child maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_24-p2_b\"></a>(b)     That the Mother can afford to cover the resulting shortfall in maintenance payments if the Variation Application is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Enforcement Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given the above finding, it follows that the Father has also failed to establish a good reason for not complying with the Maintenance Order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     During the hearing on 16 July 2025, I was informed that the maintenance arrears came to a total of €16,100.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     After hearing the parties, I made the following orders to enforce the payment of the maintenance arrears:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Father is to <b>pay the arrears</b> in one lump sum on or before <b>1 September 2025</b>. He has sufficient funds to comply with this order: see [16] above.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Father is to <b>show proof of the above payment</b> by <b>4 September 2025</b> by 10.00 am. The show-payment may be done online.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_27-p2_c\"></a>(c)     In default of show-payment, the Father is to serve <b>four weeks’ imprisonment</b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     It is well settled that a child’s interests are paramount in family matters. It follows from this that a child’s welfare cannot be collateral damage to the personal financial preferences of a parent who is supposed to pay for the child’s maintenance. Where there is credible evidence that the paying parent has substantial resources, it is only fair to expect that parent to draw upon those resources to discharge his/her maintenance obligations. Parents are expected to make sacrifices for their children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In this case, the Father is not devoid of means. Putting aside the retrenchment benefits ($78,314.99), he has about $1,506,566.53 in disposable assets: see [16(G)]. Allowing the Variation Application will have placed on the Mother (who has far less means) a disproportionate financial burden. It is manifestly unfair to allow the Father to preserve his assets at the Mother’s expense. This is especially so when he had chosen to use his retrenchment benefits to purchase the Philippine property for his partner’s daughter. These benefits could be used to provide for about 23 months<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_39\" id=\"Ftn_39_1\"><sup>[note: 39]</sup></a></span> of child maintenance. In this case, fairness requires the Father to liquidate his assets, even at some financial loss, if this is necessary to meet his continuing legal and moral duty to maintain his children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Accordingly, the Variation Application is dismissed, and the Enforcement Application is allowed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a

The Wife did not object to the inclusion of the 2 incidents:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_i\"></a>i.     21 August 2024 - Wife accusing Husband eavesdropping and recording conversations and snatching Husband’s phone.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     18 September 2024 - Wife yelling at Stepdaughter for no reason.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       In her application in SS1532, the Wife relied on another incident:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_\"></a>-    9 August 2024 - Husband threatened to hit or kill the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The 3 applications were jointly heard on 12 February 2025 and adjourned to enable counsel to prepare written submissions. On 24 March 2025, the following decisions were made in respect of the 3 applications:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_i\"></a>i.     SS1475 – Protection order made against the Husband for the protection of the Wife and the Son based on the incidents that took place on 7 January 2024, 13 April, 23 April and 17 June 2024. Both the Wife and Husband were ordered to attend mandatory counselling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     SS1511 - Application by the Husband was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_9-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     SS1532- Protection order and a domestic exclusion order made against the Husband for the protection of the Wife for the incident that took place on 9 August 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband has appealed against the whole of my decisions in the 3 applications. For completeness, I set out the reasons for all my decisions in 3 applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The parties were married in 2022 and blessed with two children, one of whom is the Son involved in SS1475. The other child is not involved in any of the 3 applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Wife also has 2 children from her previous marriage who are the Stepson and Stepdaughter of the Husband whom the Husband also sought to protect in SS1511.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits and submissions filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Wife filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_i\"></a>i.     Wife’s affidavit sworn on 23 September 2024 (CA1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Wife’s affidavit in reply to SS1511 sworn on 25 September 2024 (CA2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Wife’s 1st witness (AW1)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_iv\"></a>iv.     Wife’s 2nd witness (AW2)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_v\"></a>v.     Wife’s 3rd witness (AW3)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W3).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_vi\"></a>vi.     Wife’s 4th witness (AW4)’s affidavit sworn on 16 September 2024 (W4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Husband filed the following affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_i\"></a>i.     Husband’s affidavit affirmed on 6 January 2025 (RA1).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Husband’s supplementary affidavit affirmed on 7 February 2025 (RA2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The following written submissions were submitted:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_i\"></a>i.     Wife’s main submission dated 3 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Husband’s main submission dated 3 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Wife’s reply submission dated 14 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_iv\"></a>iv.     Husband’s reply submission dated 13 March 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Law</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The provisions of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“Charter”) that apply in the 3 applications are those under the former sections 64 and 65 as the new provisions only came into effect on 2 Jan 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     To obtain a protection order, the applicant must prove the two elements, on a balance of probabilities. Firstly, that “family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed”: s 65(1). Family violence is defined in s 64 of the as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The second element requires the applicant to establish that the protection order is necessary for the protection of the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The decision to make a protection order is thus a two-stage process. First is to determine whether there was any family violence committed or likely to be committed within the definition of family violence under section 64. Second is whether a protection order is necessary for the protection of the family member concerned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Where a protection order is issued, under section 65(5)(a) the Court may also issue a domestic exclusion order and under section 65(5)(b) a counselling order if the court thinks fit having regards to all the circumstance of the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I will first deal with whether there was any family violence committed or likely to be committed based on the two applications by the Wife followed by the application by the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Wife’s Applications against Husband (SS1475 and SS1532) </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The following were the evidence given by the Wife, her witnesses and the Husband in descending order of the incidents alleged, that is starting from the most recent to the oldest. My findings of fact, whether for or against the party concerned are set out at the end of each incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13 September 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Husband kept knocking on the door of the room in which the Wife was sleeping. She told him to stop as she and the children needed to sleep. However, despite her pleas to stop, the Husband continued with his irresponsible actions. The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband’s act had “tormented, harassed and distressed” the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband submitted that no family violence committed. The Wife did not provide any Closed-Circuit Television (“CCTV”) footages or audio recordings of this incident. The Wife, in cross examination, also confirmed that this incident did not involve any hurt or threat of causing hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I came to the view that there was no family violence committed. The Wife’s counsel erroneously relied on the new definition of family violence which includes conduct which torments, harasses or distresses the victim and thus inapplicable<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> in this case. Even if considered under the applicable definition, the acts alleged were insufficient to amount to “continual harassment” under limb (d) of the definition of family violence under section 64.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">9 August 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     The Husband told the Wife to meet him at the void deck below their flat. This was after the Wife had made her first application in SS1475 on 6 August. At the said void deck, the Husband wanted her to withdraw her application against him. However, she refused and told him that she was just protecting herself and the children from his acts of violence. To her horror, the Husband shouted angrily at her in Chinese as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Even if you have PPO, anything I want to hit or kill you, you have the PPO is useless. Do you think your PPO can help you?”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     In cross-examination she reiterated the same, that the Husband had said to her in Chinese: “if have PPO also useless anytime he want hit me kill me, this PPO also no use?”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The threatening words kept circulating in her mind for the next several days. The Wife was very disturbed, continued to be so and was afraid that the Husband might kill her or the children as the Husband had ever taken a knife to threaten her previously. Following the incident, she decided to file for a domestic exclusion order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     The Wife’s counsel submitted that by the Husband above-stated words he had wilfully or knowingly placed, or attempted to place, the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Husband denied this allegation. According to him, as set out in his affidavit <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span>, he was on his way to meet a female friend when he saw the Wife speaking to his mother at the lift lobby. The Wife shouted at him and said that his mother had proposed to buy over the matrimonial flat if the Wife did not want it. During her tirade, the Wife said that “she had filed the PPO application as a means to gauge his reaction” and that “lots of couples have filed PPO against each other, yet their marriages still thrive”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     According to him “she asserted that a true man should not retaliate against the application.” The Husband did not engage in any further conversation with her to avoid causing an outburst or an argument. The Wife then asked if he was going to meet a lady, but he ignored her. Later, the Wife called him to ask if he was cheating on her and threatened to take the children and leave him. He was worried for the children’s safety and called the police emergency hotline. She then calmed down and assured him that she would not take the children away upon being told that he had called the hotline. According to him, later that evening, he and the Wife met up to bring the children out to watch the fireworks after which they went home. In cross-examination, he maintained his stand that the incident as alleged by the Wife did not take place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     In his submissions, the Husband’s counsel pointed out that there is no other corroborative evidence on the alleged act and that based on the cross-examination done, the Wife did not seem to have a good recollection on the incidents as her evidence were riddled with inconsistencies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision .</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     I noted that the 1<sup>st</sup> application by the Wife was made on 6 August. The Summons would have been served on the Husband by 9 August before this incident took place. According to the Husband’s affidavit, when the Wife said that she had filed a PPO application against him, the Husband also did not deny having any knowledge of any PPO Summons issued against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     While the Husband had alleged that the Wife did not have any other evidence to corroborate her allegations, in the Husband’s affidavit, he informed that his mother was present on that day when he met the Wife. The mother would be the best person to corroborate his version. However, she was not called as a witness to this incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     I considered the versions given by both parties and found the Wife’s version believable and that the Husband’s version likely concocted by him and did not take place as claimed. The discrepancies in her cross-examination were minor and did not affect her credibility. The conduct displayed by the Husband as narrated by the Wife, was a more likely reaction to be expected from a respondent on being served with a court summons alleging family violence. I also found the Husband’s version incomprehensible.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     I was of the view that the words uttered by the Husband as alleged amounted to 'wilfully placing a family member in fear of hurt&quot;. There was thus family violence committed against the Wife on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The incident of 1 August is relied on by the Wife in SS1475 and the Husband in his application in SS1511.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     On 1 August at around 11pm, when the Wife saw the Husband talking on his mobile phone and smoking along the corridor outside their flat, she immediately went to one of the rooms where his Stepson (who is the Wife’s natural son) who was asthmatic, was sleeping. She found the room smelt of cigarette and the Stepson coughing. She stated that the Husband had been caught smoking in the toilet of that room previously and had confronted the Husband on his conduct. When reminded, he shouted “shut the (expletive) up” to both the Wife and the Stepson. She told him to leave the flat as it was very late, and the children needed the sleep as it was a school week.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Husband then came into the room very aggressively with his hands behind his back, shouted at her and asked what she wanted from him. He then spat at her face and in response, she spat back at him. The Husband then spat at her again after which she froze as he was physically bigger and heavier than her and she could see his anger on his face and his mannerism. He then rushed out of the room and returned shortly with an empty beer can. Without any warning, the Husband threw the beer can at her left head. She then called her church mates who advised her to call the police. She did not see a doctor as she was too shocked and was not bleeding but did make a police report subsequently on 20 August.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     She denied that she had caused the knee injury alleged by the Husband in the incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband’s act of spitting, shouting the vulgar words and throwing the beer can at the Wife amounted to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The evidence of the Wife’s four witnesses corroborated each other and was as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     On 1 August 2024 at around 11 pm AW3 received a call from the Wife that the Husband had spat and threw an empty beer can at the Wife’ head. He then relayed this information to three other church mates (AW1, AW2 and AW4). All the three gave evidence that they received the same information from AW3 at around 11 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The Husband averred that both parties had mutually spat at each other and that the Wife had pushed the Husband causing him to sustain an injury. In cross-examination, the Wife agreed that during the period concerned, their relationship had broken down. There was a scuffle and that the Husband had fallen and suffered an injury. He produced a medical memorandum dated 21 August 2024 stating he suffered a right knee injury due to the alleged assault by the Wife on 1 August.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband’s counsel submitted that during the cross-examination of the Husband, there were little to no inconsistencies, save for the confusion on the version of the order of the events. He also submitted, amongst other things, that the Wife has not sought to provide any evidence to oppose the Husband’s version of events aside from the difference in the parties’ sizes. She had averred that due to her smaller frame and built, she could not have possibly been able to afflict the harm described by the Husband. It was also submitted on the Husband behalf that if one had been drinking and was caught off guard, it could have been entirely possible for even someone with a smaller frame to push them and cause him to be off balance and to topple down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     In this incident, the Husband was alleged to have smoked in the room the asthmatic Step- son who was sleeping. An altercation took place, and the Husband spat at the Wife's face twice and threw a beer can at the Wife 's left head. The Wife did spit back at the Husband in the incident. The Husband then shouted, &quot;shut the (expletive) up”. The Husband's response was that he was holding an empty beer can that he was previously drinking and during the scuffle, inadvertently flung the beer can in her direction.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     In my view, the vulgar words alleged used by the Husband alone were not sufficient to place the Wife in fear of hurt. It was plausible that the Husband threw the empty can at the spur of the moment. As for the knee injury alleged by the Husband, I was not convinced that it was caused by the acts of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The incident that took place was a result of an altercation which resulted in physical exchanges. I was of the view that no family violence took place whether as against the Stepson, the Wife or the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 June 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     In the afternoon when parties were at their flat, the Husband asked the Son to accompany him to Punggol SAFRA but the Son declined as he was tired and wanted to rest. The Son then followed the Wife to one of the rooms in the flat. About 10 minutes later, the Husband charged towards them and took out his belt and tried to beat the Son. The Wife managed to block him from doing so. By then, the Son got scared and hid behind the Wife to protect himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband then shouted at the Son to get out of the flat and stand at the lift area. The Son followed his instructions. He then closed the main door forcefully while the Son was still at the lift area. The Wife pleaded with the Husband not to do that to the Son just because the Son didn’t want to go with him. He should not punish the Son and asked him to stand at the lift area. She asked, what if when the Husband were to go out and see that he had already fallen down the building. To that the Husband retorted “I told him to go, he cannot say no &quot;.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     Fearing for the Son’s safety, the Wife proceeded to quickly open the main door and asked the Son to return to the flat as she felt that children should not be out of parent’s sight even when they were punished especially in this case when the Son at that young age. The Husband then shouted at the Son to get out again, and the Wife again asked the Son to return back to the flat. This happened three times. The Husband got angrier and more shouted “the more you want to protect your son, the more I will show you what I will do to him&quot; to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     The Husband then carried the Son back to the flat, went into one of the rooms and locked the door. The Wife got very worried and searched frantically for the spare key. While doing so, she heard the Husband screamed and shouted at the Son who was crying loudly. She managed to find the spare key and when she opened the door, the Husband left the room abruptly. She then closed the door to be with the Son and found him panting breathlessly. She asked him to calm down and asked the Son what happened. She was horrified to be told that the Husband had strangled him and lifted him up towards the wall fan. In her state of shock and anger, she confronted the Husband who denied the allegations. The Husband then ran back to the room and tried to kick the Son but was prevent from doing so by the Wife who managed to block his kick. She then told the Husband that she would be calling the police. Despite that, the Husband tried to grab the Son from the Wife. She panicked and ran out of the flat, bumping into a stranger along the way.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     She then went downstairs and called her church mates for help. Her church mates persuaded her to call the police. She decided not to call after some consideration and went back to the flat. When she could not locate both the Husband and the Son there, she packed some clothing into 2 bags and was just about to leave the flat when the Husband came back. He told her that he wanted to talk but she informed him that she felt fearful at that stage and did not wish to talk. He then snatched one of the bags and threw it down the building. When she wanted to take the Son with her, the Husband stopped her. She then went down to the ground floor to retrieve the bag and went to a police station to seek assistance. After being told that her report would be investigated, she decided not to pursue as she was afraid that the Husband may end up in jail and that she wanted to hold her family together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     In cross-examination, she was asked why she did not make a police report or send the child to seek medical attention as he was strangled. She replied that she did not do so as the Son was not at home after she came back. She also did not do so on the next day as she did not see any bruises. She also did not want the Husband to get into trouble. She clarified that the Husband had tried to kick the Son, but he did not succeed as she managed to block the kick.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     When asked about the CCTV in the living room, her response was that it was installed a “long time ago” when they had a new maid<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span>. The CCTV was switched off when she was home as she wanted to save electricity. She never thought of keeping any footage as she did not expect that “it will come to this .. one day”. She only kept one recording which was given to the Husband’s counsel which was after she filed the application. The CCTV could not capture anything that happened in her room or corridor, just the living room. She disagreed that she had withheld the footages as they did not support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     The Wife’s counsel submitted that the following acts by the Husband amounted to family violence:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_i\"></a>i.     Took out his belt and tried to hit the Son with it and in doing so, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Son in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     Locked up the Son against his will for his mere refusal to go with him and in so doing, he had wrongfully confined or restrained the Son against his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_56-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     Strangled the Son and lifted him up towards the wall fan and in so doing, he had caused hurt to the Son by an act that is known (or ought to have been known) would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     As to the Husband’s claim that he had a shoulder injury and could not have done the acts alleged, the counsel submitted that the Husband did not adduce any evidence to support his assertion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     On 17 June between 2 pm and 3 pm, AW3 received a call from the Wife who informed him that the Husband had strangled the Son in one of the rooms in the flat. He advised her to call the police. AW3 then called the same three church mates to inform them of the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     The 3 church mates gave evidence that each of them received a call from AW3 at around 4 pm. AW3 informed them that he received a call from the Wife that the Husband had strangled the Son in one of the rooms in the flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’ version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     He denied that he strangled the Son and had not caused any physical harm on him. At 9.53 am, the Wife asked him to buy 2 packets of pork lard for her to cook noodles<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span>. As the supermarket did not sell the item, he told the Wife that he wished to bring the Son out while she cooked. He brought the Son out at 2 pm and was informed by the Wife that she might joined them shortly.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     When the Wife did not inform him of her whereabouts, he tried to call her but did not get any response. He then brought the Son back at around 7 pm. He submitted WhatsApp chats and screenshot photos taken with the Son<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> showing that the Son gave him a kiss on his cheek at 4.58 pm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     In his cross-examination he confirmed that he did bring the Son to Punggol SAFRA, and they had a fun day. He also claimed to have a hand injury and did not have the strength to do the acts alleged<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. In his affidavit he stated that his hand has suffered ligament injury and a dislocated finger whereby his hand strength is limited<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span>. He was also referred to the medical memo dated 25 April 2023 which stated that he “has a right wrist injury and is currently on a splint which stops the rotation of the wrist”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>. There was another memo dated 11 May 2023 that he “is suffering from a right wrist ligament injury” and the doctor also asked that he be excused from right upper limb exercises for the next 3 months. He also claimed to have a shoulder injury but did not get any doctor’s memo but could do so if needed. He disagreed that his right wrist had recovered since August 2023. He reasoned that he had defaulted in his medical appointments and that the physiotherapist had actually told him that there was nothing that could be done for his hand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     The Husband counsel also submitted that there should have been CCTV footages which could clearly show the living room and the hallway of the rooms in which the incidents took place. The Husband had requested for CCTV footages of not only this incident but also of the other incidents which the Wife had indicated in her affidavit. However, he was only provided with one CCTV footage dated 7 August 2024, which was not from the date of any of the incidents that were the subject matter of the Wife’s applications and also after the first application was filed for SS1475.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     In this regard, it was submitted on behalf of the Husband that an adverse inference be drawn against the Wife for not providing evidence which would clearly go towards supporting her case, had these events occurred. In support of that, the Husband submitted the case of <em>WRX v WRY</em> and another matter [2024] SGHC(A) 224 at [37] wherein the court noted that the drawing of adverse inference should be considered if the evidence withheld could contribute to the factual conclusion of the matter which could be significant to the ultimate apportionment of liability. Ultimately, the Court has to be satisfied that the evidence omitted is important based on the circumstances of the case. In the case at hand, contemporaneous evidence like this CCTV footage would have been undisputably helpful to ascertain which of the version of events was correct. The dispute in this case was largely factual and could have been resolved with the presence of the CCTV footages on the incidents which occurred at home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As regards the photograph of the Husband and the Son that was taken at 4.58 pm on that day, the Husband’s counsel submitted that it was unusual and unlikely for a child who has been allegedly subjected to that level of abuse to still be able to have a lovely day with the person who had allegedly subjected him to the said abuse just a few hours after the incident. The pictures did not seem to depict a bruised neck on the Son and again, the Son did not seem to be in distress being in the Husband’s care.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">CCTV footages</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     Section 116 Evidence Act 1893 was raised by the Husband’s counsel. The section and illustration (g) provide:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(g)    that evidence could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it;”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     In <em>WRX v WRY</em>, at paragraph 37, the court said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“In civil litigation, an adverse inference can be drawn that “evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it:” illustration (g) of s 116 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed). The drawing of an adverse inference is part of the process by which the court reaches a factual conclusion, which may be significant to the ultimate finding of liability (or the absence of liability) in civil actions which can involve a wide variety of breaches of rights and issues. However, importantly the court must be satisfied that the circumstances of the case, including the evidence before it, justify the adverse inference to be made.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     No evidence was led by the Husband as to the exact location of the CCTV, where it was directed and what it was capable of recording. Being occupant of the flat, it would also be within his power to access the recordings and if he had been prevented from doing that, he should have raised that in his evidence. Whilst both counsel had provided in their submissions what the CCTV was capable of, these were not in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     In cross-examination, when asked about the CCTV in the living room, the Wife’s said that the CCTV was installed when they had a new maid and that was a “long time ago”. It was switched off when the Wife was home to save electricity. The Wife never thought of keeping the recordings as she did not expect that parties will end up in litigation. She only kept one recording which was given to the Husband’s counsel after she filed the PPO. She also explained that the CCTV could not capture anything that happened in her room or corridor in view of its positioning. She also disagreed that she had withheld the footages as they did not support her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     I accepted the explanation given by the Wife that she did not have the footages of the incidents and why she had not kept the recordings of the incidents. Having considered the circumstances of the case and the evidence presented I refused to draw any adverse inference against her. The absence of any CCTV footages of the incident did not weaken her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     While the Wife's counsel explained in the submissions why the CCTV footage would not be useful, the reasons given in the submissions were not in evidence and thus inadmissible. One footage of the CCTV was also shown by the Husband in his submission which was also not in evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     What the Son related to the Wife was hearsay evidence and inadmissible. The Son was not called to give evidence. What was left was the evidence of the Wife. If I accept the evidence of the Wife as to what actually took place, the Husband would have committed family violence by hurting the Son and confining him in the room against his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Wife gave a very elaborate account of the incident that took place and did so in a coherent and convincing manner. I was satisfied that her accounts were true and whilst the Husband, had pointed out discrepancies in her evidence, they could be due to lapses due to passage of time and thus not fatal to her case. The Wife could not have fabricated such an elaborate plot, including making a call to AW3, to pin the Husband down.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Husband had produced WhatsApp chats and screenshot photo of him and the son taken at 4.58 pm. The photograph showed that the son appeared normal and happy at that moment. Whilst the son mood appeared to have changed subsequently as shown by the photograph, from the evidence given by the Wife I was satisfied there had been family violence committed against Son by the Husband earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">23 April 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     At about 8 am, the Husband threatened to report the Wife to the police and “Anti-scam” unit for withholding his monies. The Wife claimed that the Husband had asked her to manage his monies due to his online gambling addiction. He rebuked her for giving him only a daily allowance of $20, though she reminded him that she did so at his request. He again threatened her the second time to report her to the police, the “Anti-scam” unit and the bank.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Wife stated that his addiction started years ago and that he had been similarly threatening her as above. She sought her church leader’s advice, and he asked her to arrange for a discussion on 25 April with her church mates to feed his addiction. On hearing this, the Husband continued with his threat to call the police and the bank. He also told her that he had called up her office and asked to speak to her manager. He also sent the Wife a WhatsApp screen shot showing an email to her employer and the CPIB<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> with intent to harm her employment status. The Wife alleged that he then sent her multiple threats via WhatsApp and calls but she declined to answer them. She also did not give him any monies from his savings for fear that he would use them for online gambling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     At about 7 pm, the Wife went to her church to seek assistance and returned to the flat with a few church mates with a view to have a discussion with the Husband. At the flat, the Husband refused to sit down to discuss and went into one of the rooms.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_78\"></a>78     After about 5 to 10 minutes, the Husband came out of the room hurriedly, burst into anger and scolded the Wife for bringing the church mates against him. The Wife froze in fear while the church mates tried to calm the Husband down and told him that they were just trying to settle matters between the parties amicably. The Husband got angry again and proceeded to the kitchen to look for a knife. She informed that the Husband had in the past threatened to kill her with a knife after he found one in the kitchen. Since then, the Wife had hidden all the knives in the kitchen. That was the reason why the Husband was unable to find a knife in the kitchen then. The Husband then dashed out of the kitchen towards the Wife in the living room and tried to beat her while uttering in Chinese the following words:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Today I want your life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     Two male church mates managed to hold the Husband down and tried to stop him from attacking the Wife. AW3 then told the Wife to transfer the Husband’s monies back to him and let him settle his gambling addictions himself. She did as told and after the Husband had checked that she had done so, the Husband left the flat. The Wife informed that the following day the Husband told her that he had gambled all his money away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     On the Husband’s multiple non-stop threats via WhatsApp and calls to the Wife, the Wife’s counsel submitted that these amounted to continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_81\"></a>81     On the Husband’s uttering of the words “Today I want your life”, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt. The Husband had also attempted to hit the Wife but was stopped by the church mates. In so doing he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_82\"></a>82     At about 9 am, AW3 received a call from the Wife that the Husband had shouted and threatened the Wife that he would call the police and the “Anti scam” unit as the Wife had wrongfully withheld his monies. At about 6 pm he called the other 2 church mates and his wife (AW2) about the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     In relation to this incident, all the 4 witnesses stated that they recalled an incident where the Husband had asked the Wife to control his spending due to his online gaming and gambling addiction and that the Husband had told the Wife to hold on to his monies and to only give him a daily sum of $20.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     AW3 informed that he asked the 3 other witnesses to meet up at the Wife’s flat to pray for the Wife and attempt to settle the matter amicably with the Husband. According to AW3 and the other 3 members, on reaching the flat, AW3 asked the Husband to sit down and have a talk. The Husband ignored him and went into the master bedroom.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     At about 10 minutes later, without any warning the Husband came out and shouted angrily at the Wife alleging that she had brought her church friends to go against him. Seeing the Wife very frightened, AW1 and AW3 quickly approached the Husband to calm him down and informed him that they were only trying to help the two resolve their problem. The Husband got very angry, hit the sofa, ran into the kitchen, opened and closed the drawer as if to look for something.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     When he came back into the room he tried to hit the Wife and said in Chinese the undermentioned words which was also heard by AW1<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> and AW3<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Today I want your life.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     AW4 stated in her affidavit that during the incident, she was distracted by two of the parties’ children who had looked out of their room and caused her to quickly approach and comfort them. AW2 clarified in her cross-examination that she actually heard the words from her husband (AW3) as she was beside him at that time<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     AW1 and AW3 managed to get hold of the Husband and prevented him from hitting the Wife. Eventually, AW3 told the Wife to transfer back the Husband’s monies and upon doing so, the Husband left the flat with his bag.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     The Husband denied the allegations and that he did not call or scold the Wife or attempted to harm her with a knife. He did however send her a WhatsApp message at 8.36 am to express his unhappiness about her withholding his monies. He also did threaten to email her company if she continued to withhold his monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Husband’s counsel submitted that the Wife’s responses did not show that she felt threatened by the Husband’s messages or that she was feeling fearful. The Husband’s position was that he merely wanted the Wife to take him seriously and to transfer his money over to him so that he could use the money. He never intended to email the Wife’s supervisor and cause issues with her career.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     As regards the witnesses’ evidence, there was no evidence of any threat with a knife involved and one of them did not in fact heard the Husband uttered the words alleged but learned that from one other witness.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The Wife also failed and/or refused to provide the CCTV footage of this incident which took place at the parties’ home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_93\"></a>93     The Wife alleged that the Husband had threatened to call the Police and Anti scam unit as well as the bank as he alleged that she had withheld his monies. He allegedly bombarded the Wife with non-stop threats via WhatsApp and in so doing had continually harassed her with intent to cause or knowing that it was likely to cause anguish.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_94\"></a>94     Subsequently, the wife brought some church mates to the house where the Husband allegedly went to the kitchen to look for knives, attempted to hit the Wife and then uttered the words “today I want your life&quot;. He was restrained by two of the church members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_95\"></a>95     The act of Husband threating to call the Police, “Anti scam” or bank does not amount to family violence. However, his attempt to hit her and the utterance of the words “Today I want your life&quot; amounted to family violence. His utterance of the threat was also heard by two of the witnesses present. There was thus family violence committed on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">13 April 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_96\"></a>96     At about 2 pm, before the start of the church service, the parties went to shop for office wear for the Husband. On that day, the Wife told the Husband not to eat his &quot;Epam&quot; pills which he had bought off the street (in Geylang) instead of from a registered doctor. She was worried he would get an overdose. He got agitated and informed her that he was going to get beer instead. After some beers the Husband hurled vulgarities and abused her for restricting him from taking the pill. Due to the conduct of the Husband, she told him that she did not wish to continue shopping and decided to return home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_97\"></a>97     The Husband followed her back and upon reaching home, he got angry again and refused to let her leave the room. He told her not to challenge him and disallowed her to go to church anymore. Traumatized by his angry face, she quickly closed the door of the room. The Husband then lighted a piece of paper and pushed it beneath the opening of the door of the room she was in. Seeing that, she quickly opened the door as she thought that the Husband was trying to set the room on fire and burned her alive. For fear for her safety, she told the Husband that she would not stop him from taking his pills anymore.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_98\"></a>98     The Husband then told her to change her clothes to “home” clothes as he was not going out anymore. She did as tell. He then told her to change back to “going out” clothes. She also did as told and this “change parade” was repeated four times on the instructions of the Husband. She then begged the Husband not to mentally torture her further and that she wanted to leave the room.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_99\"></a>99     At that point and to her horror, the Husband carried her up against her will, went to the corridor railing outside the flat, and wanted to throw her down the flat. She held on to the corridor rail and after much struggle, the Husband released her causing her to drop on the corridor floor, after which the Husband returned to the flat. The Wife then tried to call the church mates for assistance but unable to get any as they were all overseas at that time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_100\"></a>100    The Wife sent audio messages to her group via WhatsApp during the incidents<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span>. Two messages read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“I am locked in the room now. He does not allow me to go to church”</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“He made me feel that he was going to kill me. He asked me to sit in the room until 9 pm. He said if I dared to go to church today, he would kill me. He was threatening me.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_101\"></a>101    In cross-examination, she stated that incident involving the lighted paper took place at about 4 plus in the afternoon and the “whole thing” ended at 5 plus in the afternoon. She did not take any photographs or video of the incident that happened earlier though she had her phone with her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_102\"></a>102    When confronted with a photo taken from the Husband’s handphone at 5.02 pm which showed his location at the study corner of Ponggol library, she did not disagree that they were then at the library and that they must had left home prior to 5 pm and added that he was there only for 15 minutes. She was also shown another message from the Husband – “I will be at here de sofa” at 5.07 pm and “I’m at level 1” at 8.51 pm. Her evidence was that both parties went to church at 7 pm on that day. She disagreed that her evidence was fabricated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_103\"></a>103    Counsel submitted that by the Husband’s action of carrying the Wife against her will to the corridor railing outside the flat, his act of wanting to throw her down the flat and causing her to be dropped on the floor, he had caused hurt to her by an act that was known or ought to have been known would result in hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ evidence</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_104\"></a>104    Between 4 pm and 5 pm, while overseas, AW3 received a call from the Wife. She told him that the Husband had confined her in the master bedroom and refused to allow her to attend church. He further lighted a piece of paper and pushed the same beneath the door. AW2(AW3’s wife) gave evidence that at about 2 pm while overseas, he saw AW3 received a call from the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_105\"></a>105    In cross examination, AW3 was shown the photo at page 32 of RA1 which showed a photo of the library and the message from the Husband stating “I at the study corner here” at 5.02 pm. AW3 commented that the church timing was 7 pm and that the Wife did not go to church as the Husband wanted to lock her in her bedroom until 9 o’clock. AW3 was referring to the message sent by the Wife to his group exhibited at page 41 Tab D which reads “He made me feel that he was going to kill me. He asked me to sit in the room until 9 pm.” AW3 was in Taiwan then and he stated that the Wife did not go to church on the basis that the other group members would inform him if she did not go<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_106\"></a>106    The Husband denied the allegations. He stated that it was not realistic for him to slide a piece of burning paper without burning himself. He did not suffer any burns that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_107\"></a>107    As he had ligature injuries and dislocated his shoulder twice, he would not be physically able to carry the Wife as alleged without injuring himself.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_108\"></a>108    On that day, the parties did go out at 2 pm to buy new clothes for him and that he did consume beer before walking back. On the way back, he told the Wife that he did not feel like going to church and instead wanted to go to the library to read some books. The Wife agreed and after reaching home thereafter, he had a short nap and thereafter went to the library together at around 4 pm. Thereafter they went for dinner and went home together.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_109\"></a>109    His case was that the Wife had fabricated her version of what took place that day. Based on the Wife’s evidence during the cross examination and her affidavit, the parties had gone out around 2 pm to shop and subsequently returned home. There an argument ensued, and she averred that the lighting of the paper event happened at around 3:30 pm to 4 pm and the whole incident ended around 5:00 pm. However, the Husband had contemporaneous evidence to show that he was not at home on that day at 5:00 pm as he was already in the library. As per the Wife’s evidence, the library was located in Punggol. Based on this information, the time the Husband would have taken some time between 20 to 25 minutes to travel from the parties’ home to the Punggol library located at 1 Punggol Drive One. In this regard, the Husband should have at least left the house around 4:40pm. The Wife’s witnesses’ affidavits did not state that she went to Church after meeting the Husband at the library. More alarmingly, AW3 had mentioned during his cross examination that the Wife did not attend church on this day as he mentioned he would always be informed of who was in attendance for service on that day despite not being around physically.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_110\"></a>110    AW2 gave evidence that she saw AW3 received a call from the Wife at about 2 pm while AW3 gave evidence that it was between 4pm to 5 pm. I was of the view that the discrepancy in the timing was not fatal to the Wife’s case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_111\"></a>111    The Wife evidence was that she called her church mates for assistance after the Husband had dropped her at the corridor and went back to the flat. This would have taken place before the parties went together to the library. As regards the Husband’s photo showing “I’m at level 1” at 8.51 pm, it did not state the Husband’s location when this message was sent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_112\"></a>112    On the evidence given by AW3 that the Wife did not attend church that day, his assumption was likely due to the message he received from the Wife that the Husband had asked that she sat in room until 9 pm. He reasoned that his church group would inform him if she did not attend church. However, neither he nor the other witnesses were asked if the Wife did, in fact, not attend church on that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_113\"></a>113    As regards the Husband claim that he could not have committed the acts due to his shoulder injury, I disbelieved him in view of the absence of any medical evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_114\"></a>114    I accepted the wife's version that the incidents happened before 4 pm after which the husband had ample time to make it to the library by 5 pm. I am of the view that the acts alleged by the Wife did take place and the Husband had committed family violence on this occasion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">29 February 2024 incident </p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_115\"></a>115    On this day at about 7.48 pm, the Husband started accusing the Wife via WhatsApp that she had gambled, lend monies illegally and stole his money. He also demanded that she returned him his monies. Between 7.48 pm to 8.10 pm, he sent her a total of 13 WhatsApp messages. Between 8.13pm to 8.15 pm, the Husband further called her 8 times via WhatsApp.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_116\"></a>116    The Wife got very afraid from the above acts and decided not to return to the flat and planned to do so only past midnight. She then called up the Husband’s mother to seek her assistance. The Wife was told that the Husband had gone up the parent’s house and immediately went to the kitchen to look for things. After the Husband had taken those things and put them into his bag, he dashed out of the parent’s house to look for the Wife. The Wife knew that the Husband was attempting to look for a weapon because she had personally witnessed him doing so many times previously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_117\"></a>117    When the Wife returned to the said flat, she chanced upon his opened bag and found a can opener, a pair of scissors and a bread knife inside it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_118\"></a>118    The Wife’s counsel submitted that by making the repeated messages, the Husband had tormented, harassed and caused distress to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_119\"></a>119    On the sending of multiple messages, the Husband’s stated that the reason for his repeated messages was because he did not have enough money to eat, and the Wife was unwilling to transfer some monies to him. He was initially messaging the Wife to request that she provide him with his money for lunch as the Wife had been withholding his monies under the guise of wanting to limit his spending habit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_120\"></a>120    Counsel submitted that this was an isolated incident which did not meet the threshold of family violence as at no point in time during the tirade of text messages did the Husband threatened to cause harm on the Wife. It also did not seem that the Wife was intimidated by the Husband’s messages as she seemed to have stood her ground and asserted her position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_121\"></a>121    The Wife also elaborated in her 1<sup>st</sup> Affidavit that she called the Husband’s mother for assistance and was told by Husband’s parents that he had went up their house and headed straight for the kitchen to look for things. Bearing in mind that the Wife was also not there to witness this, she stated that she immediately knew that the Husband was looking for a weapon.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_122\"></a>122    On this day, the Husband was alleged to have sent the Wife 13 WhatsApp messages within 22 minutes and made 8 calls within 2 minutes. The Wife found out from the Husband's mother that the Husband had gone to his parent’s home and went to the kitchen to look for things. The Wife stated she knew that the Husband was looking for a weapon as she had personally seen such actions before. When she returned to the flat, she chanced upon his bag which contained a can opener, a pair of scissors and a bread knife. The Husband took the position that this incident is contrived and baseless.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_123\"></a>123    In my view, the continuing acts of the Husband sending repeated WhatsApp messages and calls did not amount to family violence. It was likely that his intention was to ask her for some monies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_124\"></a>124    As for the items found in the bag by the Wife, there was no evidence that it was the Husband who had placed the bag there or the items found therein. I did not find any family violence committed based on this alleged incident.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">7 January 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"\"></a> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_125\"></a>125    On 7th January 2024, the Wife received a WhatsApp message from a woman claiming to be the Husband’s girlfriend. She apologized to the Wife for intruding into their marriage. When questioned by the Wife on the message, the Husband grabbed hold of the Wife’s arm very tightly and instead of admitting his mistake, he turned very aggressive and threatened the Wife that he would kill the said woman.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_126\"></a>126    The Husband’s act of grabbing the Wife’s arm caused her to suffer bruises. Photographs of the bruise were exhibited in her affidavit<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span>. In cross-examination she confirmed that the Husband had repeatedly grabbed her arm in many places and caused multiple bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_127\"></a>127    The Wife subsequently made an appointment with the said woman to have a talk at the flat to clarify matters. The Husband agreed with the Wife but informed that he was going to kill the said woman and thereafter leave the country. On hearing this, she quickly knelt down and begged him not to do silly things and that she would forgive him and start over again. Later, she called her church mates to the flat and 4 of them went there before the appointed time. The said woman turned up as arranged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_128\"></a>128    When the said woman asked the Husband a simple question, he flared up, turned violent and randomly picked up an object nearby and tried to throw it at her. The Wife’s church mates managed to wrestle the said object from him. The Husband then kicked the said woman. The church mates tried to grab hold of him and pushed him away from the said woman to prevent him from hurting her further. This event was witnessed by the 4 witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Witnesses’ version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_129\"></a>129    AW3 received a call from the Wife that a woman had contacted her and informed that she had a relationship with the Husband. AW3 then informed the other 3 church mates to meet up at the Wife’s flat as the Wife had told CW3 that she was afraid that the Husband might kill or hit the woman or even the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_130\"></a>130    The woman came to speak with the Wife and Husband. The 4 witnesses noted that the Husband was very angry and tried to pick a random object to throw at the woman but was stopped from doing so. He however managed to kick the woman before being restrained by AW3. He then heard the Wife telling the woman that it was impossible to hold any meaningful conversation with the Husband as he was mentally unstable. The woman thereafter left the place.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_131\"></a>131    None of the 4 witnesses stated in their affidavit that they noticed any bruise on the Wife’s arm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_132\"></a>132    However, in cross-examination, AW2 was asked about the incident of 7 January, and it was pointed out to her that she did not state in the affidavit that she saw any bruise on the Wife. She confirmed that she had not stated so in her affidavit. However, in re-examination, when shown the photograph of the bruises<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span> she stated that she did see the bruises on the Wife at the church. When further asked by the court, she clarified that she saw the actual bruise on her arm but could not remember when that was<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_133\"></a>133    The Wife’s counsel submitted that by the Husband’s act of grabbing the Wife’s arm very tightly and aggressively that caused her to arm to bruise, he had caused hurt to her by an act that he knew or ought to know would result in hurt. Counsel also submitted that by the Husband’s threat of wanting to kill the woman, he had wilfully or knowingly placed or attempted to place the Wife in fear of hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_134\"></a>134    The Husband denied that he had grabbed the Wife’s arm and caused the bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_135\"></a>135    Counsel submitted that the photographs of the bruised arm did not have any date indicated and as such it could not be ascertained for sure that the bruises were caused by the Husband during the incident on that day. There was also no medical report to substantiate her claim.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_136\"></a>136    The Wife’s counsel submitted that the Husband's act in threatening the wife that he was going to kill the woman and flee the country amounted to family violence. I was of the view that there was no family violence committed under the current definition when he threatened to kill the woman, a third party and a non-family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_137\"></a>137    However, on this day, the Wife had alleged that Husband caused her arm to bruise when he became aggressive and held her arm very tightly. She submitted photographs of the bruises which I accepted as evidence of his conduct. One of the Wife's witnesses, AW2 also confirmed that she saw the bruises on Wife 's arm at church. The absence of medical evidence was not fatal to her case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_138\"></a>138    I was of the view that family violence had been committed by the Husband's act in holding the wife's hand so tight that it caused the bruises.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">19 September 2021 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_139\"></a>139    On this day the parties had not been married. At around 9 pm, the Husband allegedly punched the Wife’s head causing her to sustain a laceration above the left eyebrow. She confirmed in cross-examination that she was punched once. In the medical report dated 29 August 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> obtained by her, it was stated that she sought medical attention at the hospital at around 9.55 pm where she was found to sustain a 1-cm laceration wound above her left eyebrow, treated and was given 3 days of medical leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_140\"></a>140    The Wife stated that she covered up the Husband conduct by informing the doctor that she tripped and fell at her home and her head hit the window frame. She did so as she wanted to preserve their relationship and was also afraid that the Husband may be arrested by the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_141\"></a>141    The Wife produced the following WhatsApp messages made with the Husband on the day of the incident as follow<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span>:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From the Wife at 21.54 pm:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“Doctor said my injuries is very deep have to go for stitching, Thank you.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And it will leave a scar no matter how long, the scar will still be there. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">May have to go x-ray as my head scale goes in.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Please stop ruining people’s life. Go away far from me, plsss!!!!. 21.58</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Husband at 22.27 pm:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>“U know I never mean to injure u</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>What can I do to amend</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>I am sorry.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Kelly u say I ruin ur life</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Now u inside hospital, I sit down here wait for u.”</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_142\"></a>142    She disagreed with the Husband’s version that there had been a quarrel that day and she tripped and hit the left side of her head against the window ledge. He then took her to the hospital and had apologized as he felt guilty and that their “fight had indirectly caused (her) to hit”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_143\"></a>143    The Husband stated the parties were involved in an argument. The incident happened as mentioned in the medical note, that she had tripped and fell and her reason that she did not want the Husband to be in trouble should be weighed against her “constant inconsistencies” between her own affidavit and oral evidence and even with her witnesses during her cross-examination, and in view of that, there were reasons to believe that her version was doubtful.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_144\"></a>144    Further, it was pointed out that she suffered a laceration and normally, it would be consistent to have bruising around the area if she was in fact punched. However as noted in the medical memo, there was no mention of any bruises or contusions. In this light, the Husband’s counsel submitted that her evidence was a contrived version of the events.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_145\"></a>145    Whilst there was inconsistency between the Wife’s narration of how she suffered the injury in the medical memo, the police report and her evidence at the hearing, what was telling was that in the WhatsApp messages between the two parties on the day of incident, the Husband had impliedly admitted to the alleged wrongdoing when he said:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">&quot;U know I never did mean it. I don't mean to injure u. What can I do to amend. I am sorry.&quot;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_146\"></a>146    I rejected the counsel’s contention that the Wife should have suffered bruises or contusions from the single punch instead of laceration as these were matters for expert medical opinion.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_147\"></a>147    I noted that the parties were only married on 14 September 2022. While this occurred when the parties were not yet &quot;family members”, I was of the view that I could still take this incident into account in considering whether family violence &quot; is likely to be committed against a family member&quot;, that is, the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Husband’s application against the Wife (SS1511)</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">30 July 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_148\"></a>148    In paragraph 30 of RA1, the Husband alleged that the Wife pushed him causing him to hit his head against the wooden door. This was during the time when the Wife felt suspicious of him going out to meet girls and also due to her being very controlling. At about 9 pm, as the Husband was about to go out to meet his friend, the Wife hit him on his stomach as she did not like his friend<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_149\"></a>149    In cross- examination, an issue of discrepancy was brought up relating to the version of events, whether the punching came first or the hitting of the head, or if they occurred at the same time. The Husband averred he might have been confused, and that the incident would have been captured by the CCTV.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_150\"></a>150    She denied the allegations which was set out in a single paragraph of the Husband’s affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_151\"></a>151    Counsel submitted that there were factual discrepancies that indicated that the Husband was not truthful. In his police report of 2 August 2024<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>, he stated “she then walked past me and gave me a punch to my stomach and also pushed me on my chest causing me to hit my head on the wooden door. I felt pain but was not injured”. However, in his affidavit he stated “the (Wife) pushed me causing me to fall backwards and hit my head on the wooden door of our house and hit my head on the wooden door of our house. …. At around 9 pm on the same day, I was about to head out to meet my friend (A) when (the Wife) hit me on my stomach as she did not like my friend.”</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_152\"></a>152    As regards the injury, he stated that he felt pain only and was not injured in his police report. However, in cross-examination he stated that he was injured but the police report writer typed “was not injured” as he had told the officer that he had not seen a doctor yet<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My Decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_153\"></a>153    The Husband gave only a scanty detail of his allegations found in the 3 sentences in paragraph 8 of RA1. Despite that, they differed with the version he gave to the police in his police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_154\"></a>154    I was of the view that the discrepancies were material as they created doubts as to firstly, whether the two assaults took place at the same time or at separate times and secondly, whether he was punched before being pushed. The Husband reliance on the CCTV did not assist his case for the same reasons given earlier.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_155\"></a>155    On the evidence I was not satisfied that there was family violence committed against the Husband on this day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">1 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_156\"></a>156    This incident was dealt with in paragraphs 37 to 48. My decision was that there was no family violence committed by either party on this date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">21 August 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_157\"></a>157    It is to be noted that the complaint by the Husband in SS1511 was filed on 8 August 2024 and this allegation that took place on 21 August 2024 and the next incident mentioned below, took place on 18 September 2024. As the Wife’s did not raise any objection, I proceeded to hear these 2 allegations, instead of asking the Husband to file a fresh complaint which would further require part-heard or fresh hearing dates.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_158\"></a>158    On 21 August 2024 at about 1.16 am, the Wife found the Husband standing outside her door when she came out and accused him of recording her conversations with the children. She forcibly snatched the handphone he was holding<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span>. This was admitted by the wife in her cross-examination. He claimed to have heard the Wife telling the children that he was dangerous and that they should stay away from him. He had audio recordings to prove the matter which were submitted in RA2. The Husband sought to show, in the audio recordings, that the Wife was the aggressor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_159\"></a>159    The Husband also pointed out that the Wife had not sought to provide her responses with regard to this incident in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit filed on CA2. The Wife had also agreed that the snatching of the phone could potentially cause harm and hurt.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_160\"></a>160    While there was no response by the Wife in her affidavit, it was submitted on her behalf that she only did so because the Husband was recording her conversation with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_161\"></a>161    The Husband’s claim of being intimidated, fearful and emotional distressed as stated in paragraph 10 of RA1 were bare allegations which the Wife denied in its entirety and that there was no family violence committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_162\"></a>162    In this incident, the Husband main complaint was that the Wife had snatched his phone forcefully. The Wife admitted doing so as the Husband had secretly recorded her conversation with the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_163\"></a>163    The Husband had raised that she failed to respond to his allegations made in his 1<sup>st</sup> affidavit in RA1. I noted that RA1 was filed only on 6 January 2025, long before the Wife filed her affidavit on 25 September 2024 in response to SS1511. As the Wife had also addressed the matter in her submissions, such failure was not taken against her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_164\"></a>164    I was of the view that the conduct of Wife in snatching the phone from the Husband whom she thought was recording conversations she was having with the children did not amount to family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">18 September 2024 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_165\"></a>165    The Husband claimed that the Wife had a tendency of being verbally abusive towards the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> On this day, his Stepdaughter send him a WhatsApp message to inform him that the Wife had been yelling at her for no reason and asked him to return home as soon as possible as she was feeling “really frightened”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_166\"></a>166    The messages <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> read as follow:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Stepdaughter:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>19.26- Missed video call</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>23.11 Mummy keep on scolding me</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>23.13 This message was deleted</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.35 I want you come back home [with Crying emoji]</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">From Husband:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23.51- dont cry girl you sleep early</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_167\"></a>167    In cross-examination, the Husband informed that at 7.26 pm, he did not know where the Stepdaughter was or what she was doing but agreed that at 11 pm, she was with the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_168\"></a>168    The Husband had also alleged that the Wife had verbally abused him in front of the children on many different occasions, calling him derogatory names, questioning his competence and making demeaning remarks. She also yelled at the children, called them names and use vulgar language<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_28\" id=\"Ftn_28_1\"><sup>[note: 28]</sup></a></span>. These had created an environment of fear and insecurity in the household.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_169\"></a>169    To support the Husband’s allegations, he submitted 3 audio recording in support of his case in all three applications <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_170\"></a>170    As regards the incident of 18 September, the Husband similarly pointed out that the Wife did not respond to this allegation in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_171\"></a>171    The Wife’s counsel submitted that the allegation of verbal abuse was twisted by the Husband for the following reasons:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_i\"></a>i.     The Stepdaughter did not mention “yelling”. Her exact words sent at 11.11pm to the Husband were “mummy keep on scolding me.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_ii\"></a>ii.     The Stepdaughter also did not state that she was feeling really frightened by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_171-p2_iii\"></a>iii.     After almost half an hour later, it was only at 11.51 pm that the Husband sent two messages to her and asked her not to cry (in response to her crying emoji) and to sleep early. On this, it was submitted by the Wife that the Husband must had felt so assured that he only sent two messages to the daughter instead of calling her or rushing back home, even though he was at work then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_172\"></a>172    The Wife’s position with regards to the allegations was that these were bare allegations which were denied.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_173\"></a>173    This incident allegedly took place at 7.26 pm that day and continued till 11 pm. In gist, the Husband case was that the situation seemed to be dire enough and caused his Stepdaughter to have a significant amount of distress to have called the Husband. The Stepdaughter was not called to give evidence by the Husband. No vulgar words were used by the Wife in the incident. The Wife actions, in my view was insufficient to meet threshold of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_174\"></a>174    As regards the allegations raised in paragraph 7 of RA1, I agreed with the Wife these were bare allegations which had not been substantiated.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_175\"></a>175    As regards the 3 audio recordings submitted in RA2, these did not assist the Husband in the three applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">17 October 2023 incident</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Husband’s Version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_176\"></a>176    The Husband alleged that there had been instances where the Wife would physically punish the children in an inappropriate and harmful manner citing that two of her children would be hit by a hanger by her if they disobeyed her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> He narrated that on 17 October 2023, the Wife had used a clothes hangar on the Son when he disobeyed her to the extent that the hangar broke into half and that he had to stop her to diffuse the situation. He also raised that the Wife had not refuted or address this allegation in her 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_177\"></a>177    The Husband also alleged that the Wife had vented her work stress on the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note: 31]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>Wife’s version</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_178\"></a>178    The Wife submitted that the allegation of hitting the Son with a hanger as stated was a bare allegation without evidence and which the Wife denied in its entirety. She did not commit family violence on the Son as alleged. The allegation of venting out stress was also a bare allegation without evidence which the Wife denied in its entirety.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_179\"></a>179    The allegation of family violence committed on the Son on 17 October 2023 was denied by the Wife. The allegation was made in just one sentence and thus scanty and devoid of particulars such that it was impossible for me to be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that family violence had been committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Particulars of incidents not included in complaints.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_180\"></a>180    The Husband had also, in his closing submissions, raised the point that the Wife had relied on other incidents which were not included in her application in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_181\"></a>181    Unlike pleadings in civil cases, applicants are not expected to list all instances in their complaint. The Wife was thus not precluded from citing other past incidences for the purposes of the hearing. There was also no prejudice to the Husband as he had the opportunity to respond to those allegations which were not raised in C1 and C2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Whether a protection order is necessary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_182\"></a>182    In respect of SS1511, as I found that no family violence had been committed in all the allegations made, the Husband's application was wholly dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_183\"></a>183    In SS1475, the wife had applied for a protection order for herself and the Son. In SS1532 the Wife had applied for a protection order for herself as well as a domestic exclusion order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_184\"></a>184    There were 5 incidents of family violence committed by the Husband within a period of 9 months, that is, 7 January, 13 April, 23 April, 17 June and 9 August 2024 against 2 family members. I was satisfied that a protection order was necessary for the protection and safety of the Wife and the Son in respect of SS1475.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_185\"></a>185    In respect of the Wife’s application in SS1532 for a domestic exclusion order, I was of the view that the Husband’s acts of violence and the threats uttered involving the taking of one’s life, not on one but two occasions, were serious enough to warrant the issuance of a domestic exclusion order in addition to a protection order. Based on the circumstances of the allegations that had been proven, I was also satisfied that Wife would continue to be at risk if the Husband remained in the home and so ordered a domestic exclusion order against him for the whole flat.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_186\"></a>186    I also ordered both parties to attend counselling. No order as to cost was made as the Husband was legally aided.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>In section 58B(4)(a)-“Emotional or psychological abuse” means conduct or behaviour that-(a)torment, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>At RA1 at paragraphs 16 to 20.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Notes of Evidence (NE) at page 29 line 16 onwards.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>At RA1 page 28 Tab D.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Ibid page 29.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>NE page 108 line 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>At RA1 page 7 para 26.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Ibid page 25.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, the law enforcement arm dealing with corruption.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>AW1 affidavit at para 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>AW3 affidavit at para 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>NE at page 76 line 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>CA1 at Tab D pages 39 to 42.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>NE at page 88 line 7 to line 11.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>CA1 at pages 50-53.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>CA1 page 50.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>NE page 90 line 10.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>CA1 at page 57.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Ibid at page 58.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>NE at page 25 line 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>RA1 at para 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>Ibid page 16.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>NE page 137 line 28.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>The allegations could be found in paragraphs 10 and 11 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>This can be found in paragraph 12 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>These can be found at Tab-B at RA1 page 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>NE page 161 line 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_28_1\" id=\"Ftn_28\">[note: 28]</a></sup>These can be found in paragraph 7 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_29_1\" id=\"Ftn_29\">[note: 29]</a></sup>In his 2<sup>nd</sup> affidavit RA2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_30_1\" id=\"Ftn_30\">[note: 30]</a></sup>This incident could be found in paragraph 13 of RA1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_31_1\" id=\"Ftn_31\">[note: 31]</a></sup>In paragraph 14 of RA1.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Maintenance – Enforcement of show-payment orders – Applicable considerations"],"date":"2025-07-02","court":"Family Court","case-number":"MSS No. 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024","title":"WOC v WOD","citation":"[2025] SGFC 72","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33472-SSP.xml","counsel":["Applicant and Respondent in person."],"timestamp":"2025-07-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>WOC v WOD</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WOC <em>v</em> WOD </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33472-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 72</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The present case provides an opportunity to re-iterate this principle.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Enforcement of maintenance order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       In November 2024, the Applicant made an application to recover maintenance arrears from the Respondent (her ex-husband): MSS 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       After a trial, a judge found that the maintenance arrears came to $30,420 as of May 2025 (“<b>Proven Arrears</b>”). To enforce the payment of these arrears and the payable maintenance, the judge made the following orders (“<b>May Order</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent was to pay the Proven Arrears by monthly instalments of $600/month for child maintenance (MSS 2158/2024) and $600/month for mutaah (MSS 2519/2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Additionally, the Respondent was to pay the payable maintenance at $1,063/month (MSS 2519/2024).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The above payments (totalling $2,263/month) were to be paid on the first day of each month, commencing from 1 June 2025.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The Respondent was to show payment for the payments in (a) and (b) above on three occasions – namely, 6 June 2025 (first show-payment), 7 July 2025 (second show-payment) and 6 August 2025 (last show-payment).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In default of each show-payment for MSS 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024, the Respondent will have to serve one day’s imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Failure to comply with show-payment order</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       On 2 June 2025 (i.e., four days before the first show-payment), the Respondent requested, via email, the Court to allow the relevant payments to be made on the 10<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> day of each month because of his company’s payment structure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       On 9 June 2025, the Court replied to the Respondent, via email, that he was to attend court on 12 June 2025 to show payment. In the email, the Court highlighted two things. <em>First</em>, that the Respondent could file an application to vary the May Order. <em>Second</em>, and importantly, that a “[f]ailure to attend Court proceedings will attract the usual consequences”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       On 12 June 2025, the Respondent failed to attend court. He did not provide any explanation for this absence either before or after the 12 June show-payment. A warrant to arrest was duly issued against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Respondent was arrested on 24 June 2025. He appeared before me on 1 July 2025 to explain his absence from court on 12 June and to address the show-payment issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applicable considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       At this juncture, I wish to make a few observations about show-payment proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     First, a show-payment order serves an important purpose. It allows a Court to monitor whether a person who has been ordered to pay maintenance (“<b>payor</b>”) complies with the order. The Court’s power to imprison a payor for failing to show payment can be a powerful incentive for obeying maintenance orders. For show-payment orders to serve their intended purpose, they <em>ought to be strictly enforced</em> unless there are good reasons not to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Second (and this point follows from the first), a <em>payor has the burden to prove</em> to the court’s satisfaction that he/she has duly complied with a show-payment order. For instance, if the order requires the payor to pay a specified amount into a specified bank account by a specified date, then he/she must be able to prove in a straightforward manner that these directions have been duly complied with. These requirements can be easily met, e.g., by producing the relevant bank transaction record. If a payor fails to clearly show such proof, then a court may find that payment has not been shown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Third, if a payor fails to show payment, then he/she must show <em>good cause</em> (i.e., good reason) for such a failure. Otherwise, he/she will have to serve the imprisonment term that has been imposed in default of show-payment. A <em>bare assertion</em> – e.g., that the payor cannot afford to pay – is not enough. There are at least three reasons for this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>One</em>, the amount of maintenance and arrears to be paid would have been determined either (i) with the payor’s consent or (ii) after a court has scrutinised his/her financial circumstances.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Two</em>, a relaxed attitude towards enforcing show-payment orders – e.g., allowing payors’ applications (i) to defer show-payment proceedings multiple times or (ii) to pay smaller amounts for each show-payment proceeding – can prejudice the beneficiary of a maintenance order. This is because “[m]aintenance orders are premised on the ongoing and immediate needs of the particular family; hardship may arise where arrears remain unpaid”: <em>VWB v VWA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/29432-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHCF 13</a> at [23]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_12-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Three</em>, a finding that good cause is shown so long as payment is made – even if it is made after the show-payment date – can allow vindictive payors to deliberately and repeatedly delay payments for the purpose of causing hardship to the beneficiary or for other ulterior motives.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     Finally, during show-payment/show cause hearings, payors sometimes claim that there has been a material change in their circumstances, and that this makes it difficult or impossible for them to comply with the maintenance orders or show-payment orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Often, such claims may be bare assertions or unmeritorious as the alleged new circumstances were already existent at the time of the enforcement order. In such cases, the Court will proceed to enforce the default imprisonment term.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On the other hand, if there is a genuine change of circumstance that makes it difficult or impossible to comply with the maintenance orders or show-payment orders, then the payor should consider applying to <em>vary</em> the maintenance order expeditiously. This is because a show-payment/show cause hearing is not suited to assess (i) the credibility of a claim of a material change in circumstances, and (ii) the payor’s financial circumstances. A variation application, on the other hand, will allow the payor and the beneficiary to properly present the relevant evidence and to effectively address the relevant issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Applying the considerations</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Respondent has failed to show cause</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Having summarised the applicable considerations, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     At the outset, I note that the Respondent had given conflicting reasons for failing (1) to comply with the direction to show-payment on 12 June and (2) to attend court that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Initially, the Respondent claimed that he did not receive any notice to attend court on 12 June 2025. This claim is clearly untrue – as the Court had sent him an email in response to his own request for a postponement of the 6 June show-payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     When the Respondent was questioned regarding the Court’s email, he shifted his position. He admitted to having seen the email but claimed that it did not state that he had to attend court. Again, this claim is contradicted by the text of the email which I reproduce below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Dear Sir,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">We refer to the above matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">2.    Please note that the matter was mentioned on 6 June 2025 and the Judge has directed you to show payment on the said date and time as below:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"7.89842031593681%\"><col width=\"39.4721055788842%\"><col width=\"28.9342131573685%\"><col width=\"23.6952609478104%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Court Event</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Date/Time</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b><em>Venue</em></b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Show Payments</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">($1663.00 in MSS2518/2024 and $600.00 in MSS2519/2024)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>12 June 2025</em> / 10.30AM</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>FJC Service HUB (Counter 8)</em> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\">Note: The Court has provided this one-time exception for you to <em>attend Court</em> for Show Payment on the above date.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-3\"> <em>You may file for a Variation online</em> using your Singpass <em>to vary the terms of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">3.     <em>Failure to attend Court proceedings will attract the usual consequences.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[italics added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When the Respondent was referred to the above text, he changed his position, again. This time, he claimed – astonishingly – that his intention was to show payment only when he had sufficient funds to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     In my view, the Respondent had failed to show cause. Based on his explanations, it appears that the Respondent (a) did not give due regard to court orders and court emails, (b) did not take his obligation to pay maintenance and show payment seriously, and/or (c) was making up excuses along the way. In the circumstances, I find it appropriate to enforce the default imprisonment term on the Respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     In coming to this finding, I am mindful that the Respondent did <em>eventually</em> make payment of –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,000 on 13 June – i.e., after the Court had ordered a warrant of arrest to be issued against him, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $1,263 on 30 June – i.e., on the eve of the show cause hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     When questioned about the late payments, the Respondent claimed that he was facing financial difficulties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In my view, the Respondent has failed to show good cause for making the payments late.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Respondent did not provide any evidence to substantiate his bare assertion about his alleged financial difficulties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Indeed, I note that the Respondent had made a similar assertion before the trial judge in May 2025. The judge disbelieved it. This is because – according to the judge – the Respondent had intentionally failed to disclose the full extent of his income and liabilities in the proceedings before her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, the Respondent has multiple food businesses. There is no evidence to show that he was completely unable to comply with the May Order – even if his business was not doing well.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     That said, I did grant a concession to the Respondent for having made the June payments (although belatedly) – by ordering the two terms of imprisonment for MSS 2518/2024 and MSS 2519/2024 to run concurrently.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Applicant’s request</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     During the hearing, the Applicant requested that I make an order to enforce the payment of the Proven Arrears in full. She made this request because she is stressed that the Respondent had repeatedly failed to pay maintenance and had dragged out the enforcement process. She also highlighted that despite being allowed to pay the Proven Arrears in instalments, he has defaulted on the very first instalment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am not prepared to make the order that the Applicant had requested. These are my reasons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, I note from the records that when making the May Order, the trial judge <em>had in fact considered – and decided against</em> – ordering the Respondent to pay the Proven Arrears in one lump sum. This is because she had found that he would be unable to do so and had thus ordered him to pay the arrears by instalments instead.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, in the absence of evidence and a proper investigation into the Respondent’s current financial circumstances, I have no basis to arbitrarily decide that the Respondent can now pay the Proven Arrears in one lump sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, it bears highlighting that the purpose of a show-payment proceeding is to enforce a show-payment order made by an earlier court. Such a proceeding is neither intended nor equipped to conduct a full hearing to determine afresh how payment of the Proven Arrears is to be enforced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_22-p2_d\"></a>(d)      <em>Finally</em>, the show-payment order by the trial judge is <em>still subsisting.</em> There are two more show-payments – on 7 July and 6 August. In the circumstances, that order will have to run its course.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     Before concluding, I wish to make a few observations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     During the hearing, parties had expressed dissatisfaction with the present status. The Respondent claimed that he did not have the means to comply with the May Order and would end up having to repeatedly serve imprisonment in default of making the instalment payments. On the Applicant’s side, she found the May Order to be ineffective in ensuring that the Proven Arrears will be paid fully and in a timely manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Regarding the Respondent’s dissatisfaction, the Court had already informed him on 9 June 2025 that he can apply to vary the May Order: see [15(b)] above. When I reminded him of this option during the hearing, the Respondent gave a surprising reply – that he had businesses to run and could not afford to take time off to make a variation application. It appears that the Respondent is prepared to be imprisoned rather than prove that he genuinely cannot afford to pay the Proven Arrears.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As for the Wife, she can apply to enforce the full payment of the Proven Arrears after the show-payment order lapses – which will be soon, in about a month’s time. It bears noting that such an application will be governed by the enhanced maintenance enforcement framework. Under this framework (which was introduced in January 2025), a maintenance enforcement officer has extensive powers to assist the court to scrutinise the Respondent’s finances and means to pay both the Proven Arrears and the ongoing maintenance. Such an application, if made, can allow the relevant issues to properly ventilated and the evidence rigorously scrutinised in a hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Finally, I wish to stress that Courts take a serious view regarding non-compliance with maintenance orders and show-payment orders. Such non-compliance has a corrosive effect on respect for court orders and confidence in our maintenance regime. Further, a failure to pay maintenance can cause hardship to their intended beneficiaries.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It is aggravating if a payor <em>can</em> make pay the maintenance but <em>refuses</em> to do so or <em>deliberately delays</em> making timely payments. Such conduct is especially reprehensible where child maintenance is involved – as it directly harms a child’s interests. Payors who engage in such conduct can expect to receive longer imprisonment terms.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Interlocutory applications – Family Justice Rules 2014"],"date":"2025-07-01","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 2012 of 2024 (Summons Nos 578 and 1003 of 2025)","title":"XOK v XOL","citation":"[2025] SGFC 71","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33471-SSP.xml","counsel":["Pang Khin Wee (Peng Qinwei) and Leong Zhen Yang (I.R.B Law LLP) for the plaintiff","Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Fleet Street Law LLC) for the defendant."],"timestamp":"2025-07-07T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Allen Chong","html":"<root><head><title>XOK v XOL</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XOK <em>v</em> XOL </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33471-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 71</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Case Number</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Divorce No 2012 of 2024 (Summons Nos 578 and 1003 of 2025)</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Decision Date</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">01 July 2025</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Tribunal/Court</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\">Family Court</td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Coram</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Allen Chong </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Counsel Name(s)</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> Pang Khin Wee (Peng Qinwei) and Leong Zhen Yang (I.R.B Law LLP) for the plaintiff; Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Fleet Street Law LLC) for the defendant. </td></tr><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px; white-space: nowrap\" valign=\"top\">Parties</td><td class=\"info-delim1\" style=\"padding: 4px\">:</td><td class=\"txt-body\"> XOK — XOL </td></tr></tbody></table> <p class=\"txt-body\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Civil Procedure</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Affidavits</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Interlocutory applications</span> – <span style=\"font-style:italic\">Family Justice Rules 2014</span></p> <p></p><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"><tbody><tr><td width=\"80%\"><p class=\"Judg-Hearing-Date\">1 July 2025</p></td><td><p class=\"Judg-Date-Reserved\">Judgment reserved.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Author\"> Magistrate Allen Chong:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_1\"></a>1       The two present interlocutory applications raise a narrow point in family procedure: is <em>leave of court required when affidavits are filed in support of a summons application?</em> This is governed by r 42 of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“<b>FJR 2014</b>”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       In <em>WWM v WWN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/31911-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGHCF 27</a> (“<b><em>WWM</em></b>”), the High Court held in the context of ancillary matters (“<b>AM</b>”) proceedings that any non-party affidavit outside the parties’ respective affidavits of assets and means (“<b>AM affidavits</b>”) (and, in particular, a child’s affidavit) can only be filed with the court’s prior leave pursuant to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014.

The outcome of this application determines whether the children’s affidavits filed in SUM 578 (being the 17 and 18 April affidavits filed for the purposes of SUM 1003) can even remain on the record when this Court decides on SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 1003</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Leave of court is not required to file non-party affidavits (including children’s affidavits) in support of a summons</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       Rule 89(3) of the FJR 2014 governs the filing of affidavits in AM proceedings and requires parties to obtain leave of court before filing affidavits apart from the AM affidavits. This rule provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Filing of Affidavit of Assets and Means and reply affidavit</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">89.—(1)    Where there is an application for ancillary relief by a plaintiff or defendant, the parties must, if the Court so orders, file and exchange an Affidavit of Assets and Means —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    in such manner as the Registrar may direct; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    within such period as the Court may direct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    On the exchange of the Affidavits of Assets and Means, a party may file and serve on the other party a reply affidavit to the other party’s Affidavit of Assets and Means within such time as the Court may direct.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    An application for leave under paragraph (3) must be by way of summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Rules 63 to 77 apply to any application for discovery, interrogatories or inspection relating to an Affidavit of Assets and Means.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    An order for the filing of an Affidavit of Assets and Means must not be made before the granting of an interim judgment, unless the Court is of the view that such an order is necessary or desirable.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The High Court has in <em>WWM</em> held (at [4]) that the plain wording of rr 89(2) and 89(3) of the FJR 2014 provides for a total of two rounds of AM affidavits by each party and any further affidavits beyond these require the leave of court. Accordingly, this means that leave is required for the filing of non-parties’ (<em>eg</em>, children’s) affidavits in court, at least for the purposes of AM proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     Stepping outside the context of AM proceedings and for the purposes of SUM 1003, the provision applicable for the filing of affidavits for <em>summonses</em> (and originating summonses) is r 42 of the FJR 2014 which provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Filing of affidavits in originating summons or summons</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">42.—(1)    Unless the Court otherwise directs, a plaintiff or an applicant who intends to adduce evidence in support of an originating summons or a summons in Form 4 must do so by affidavit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The plaintiff or applicant must —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    file the affidavit at the time of filing the originating summons or summons, as the case may be; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    serve a copy of the originating summons or summons together with the supporting affidavit, on every defendant or respondent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The defendant or respondent who intends to adduce evidence with reference to the originating summons or summons served on him must file an affidavit-in-reply and serve a copy of it on the plaintiff or applicant not later than —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>a</em>)    in the case of an originating summons, 21 days after being served a copy of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s affidavit under paragraph (2); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(<em>b</em>)    in the case of a summons, 14 days after being served a copy of the plaintiff’s or applicant’s affidavit under paragraph (2).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    Where the defendant or respondent has served a copy of an affidavit-in-reply in respect of an originating summons filed by a plaintiff or applicant, the plaintiff or applicant may not file a further affidavit without the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    Unless the Court otherwise directs, where the defendant or respondent has served a copy of an affidavit-in-reply in respect of a summons filed by a plaintiff or applicant, the plaintiff or applicant may file a further affidavit and serve a copy of the affidavit on the defendant or respondent within 14 days after being served with the affidavit-in-reply.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(6)    This rule shall not apply to any Affidavit of Assets and Means or reply affidavit filed under rule 89.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(1)   The restrictive and permissive readings of r 42 of the FJR 2014</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The fork in the road is whether r 42 of the FJR 2014 establishes the requirement for a party to obtain the leave of court before filing any affidavit sworn/affirmed by a deponent who is not a party. Two contrasting positions emerge:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Leave is required:</b> Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 confines affidavits to those sworn by the parties <em>themselves</em>. A non-party affidavit may be filed only with the court’s prior leave. I call this the “restrictive reading” of r 42. I understand this to be the defendant’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Leave is not required:</b> Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 regulates the sequence and number of rounds of affidavits, not the identity of the deponent. At each round, parties may file non-party affidavits without first seeking the leave of court. I refer to this as the “permissive reading” of r 42. I understand this to be the plaintiff’s position.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(2)   The permissive reading of r 42 ought to be preferred</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In my view, the <em>permissive reading</em> of r 42 ought to be preferred. Before I set out my reasons below, I note that r 42 governs the procedure for the filing of affidavits for <em>both</em> originating summonses and summonses. The present dispute in SUM 1003, however, arises solely from the filing of non-party affidavits in a <em>summons</em> (<em>ie</em>, SUM 578). My analysis and more specifically, any construction I place on r 42, therefore, relates to the operation of the rule in the context of a <em>summons</em> filed in the course of an existing action. To the extent that my views touch on how r 42 applies to affidavits filed for the purposes of originating summonses, these views are made by way of <em>obiter</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(3)   The purposive interpretative approach applies to r 42 of the FJR 2014</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The FJR 2014 are subsidiary legislation. Section 9A of the Interpretation Act (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>IA</b>”) provides that the starting point for ascertaining the meaning of such legislation is the ordinary meaning of its words, taking into account its context: <em>Reignwood International Investment (Group) Co Ltd v Opus Tiger 1 Pte Ltd and other matters</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/26165-SSP.xml')\">[2021] SGHC 133</a> at [64], citing <em>Tang Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [37].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     At the outset, I note that according to the Table of Derivations in the FJR 2014, r 42 is derived from Rule 5A of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Rules 2006 (Cap. 353, R4) (“<b>MPR</b>”). This rule was introduced via r 19 of the Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) (Amendment) Rules 2013 (G.N. No. S 676/2013) and which came into operation on 2 December 2013. There appears to have been no preparatory materials released on the formulation of this specific rule in r 5A of the MPR (save for one article written about the rule which could potentially shed light on the intent behind this rule, which I deal with below at [25]). The further submissions of both counsels have also not referred me to any such materials. As has been observed by Steven Chong J (as he then was) in <em>ANB v ANF</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2011] 2 SLR 0001.xml')\">[2011] 2 SLR 1</a> at [22] relation to the Rules of Court 2014 (“<b>ROC 2014</b>”), such rules are typically drafted and introduced by a Rules Committee and the proceedings of this committee are confidential. There is no equivalent of the Hansard or other preparatory materials that can be used to interpret any particular provision of the Rules of Court (or the MPR or the FJR 2014 for that matter). In such circumstances, resort must be had to case law or academic commentary, where relevant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(4)   Rule 42 of the FJR 2014 governs the sequence of steps for the exchange of affidavit evidence and does not speak to the identity of deponents</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     In my view, the ordinary meaning of r 42, read within its <em>context</em>, establishes the <em>sequence</em> of steps for the exchange of affidavit evidence in applications begun by summonses. The sequence is as follows (see <em>Chong Yeo and Partners and another v Guan Ming Hardware and Engineering Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0030.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 30</a> (“<b><em>Chong Yeo</em></b>”) at [67], as to how applications for summary judgment under O 14 r 2 of the Rules of Court 1996 (and by extension, ROC 2014) <span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> establishes a “three-stage process” for the filing of affidavits for such applications):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The plaintiff or applicant must file any evidence together with the summons by way of a supporting affidavit (rr 42(1) and 42(2) of the FJR 2014). This represents the first step in the sequence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Next, the defendant or respondent has 14 days from service of that summons to file and serve an affidavit-in-reply (r 42(3)(b) of the FJR 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, if such affidavit-in-reply is served on the applicant, the plaintiff or applicant is entitled, and within the next 14 days, to put in his final reply affidavit (r 42(5) of the FJR 2014).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     Rule 42 is silent as to whether any leave of court is required before non-parties’ affidavits may be filed. In other words, r 42 is silent as to the <em>identity</em> of a person who may depose to an affidavit to be relied on for the purposes of a summons.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I would distinguish <em>WMM</em> on the basis that, it is a decision relating strictly to the filing of affidavits for the purposes of AM proceedings. There, the High Court held that according to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 there is a requirement for leave to be granted before a party may file any affidavit beyond the parties’ respective AM affidavits. In my view, that decision does not take the defendant’s case for the restrictive reading very far. Rule 89 concerns the procedure for the filing of AM affidavits <em>in the context of AM proceedings</em>. These are matters intrinsically personal to the parties in the sense that only the assets and means of the parties concerned. These are matters which the parties should be able to shed light on by way of their own evidence. A related point of observation is that the family court’s powers under s 112 of the Women’s Charter 1961 (2020 Rev Ed), which often features in AM proceedings and is a key provision apart from the other powers of the family court under Chapter 4 of the same Act, is limited only to the division of matrimonial assets belonging to the <em>parties of the marriage</em>, not property belonging to third parties. This point was the subject of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in <em>UDA v UDB and</em> another <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21828-SSP.xml')\">[2018] 1 SLR 1015</a> at [44]. To my mind, these pointers explain why affidavits for the purposes of AM proceedings should rightly be generally limited to affidavits sworn by the parties themselves.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     By contrast, r 42 governs a <em>broader</em> type of proceedings (namely, summonses) as opposed to the determination of ancillary matters. By its very nature, summonses can come in much more varied forms, involving a broader set of legal issues than merely issues arising in the context of ancillary relief. Typically, ancillary relief is confined to division of matrimonial assets, maintenance and children’s issues. Thus, it is conceivable that in summonses, evidence from a wider pool of sources with personal knowledge of the facts (for example, solicitors, parents, children, teachers, among other possible individuals) may potentially be useful to deal with the varied issues that arise. This aligns with the rationale underlying the regime for summary judgment applications under O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 (see below at [21]) which permits the filing of multiple affidavits on the premise that no single person would likely have knowledge of all the facts. This is quite unlike that of the AM proceedings, where matters may sometimes even proceed based on the AM affidavits of one party (<em>eg</em>, where the other party is absent). Hence, I do not think that this logic, which underpins r 89, transposes perfectly onto r 42.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Furthermore, there is, in any case, a <em>contrast</em> in the wording employed in r 42 and r 89. Rule 89(3) employs mandatory, exclusionary language: “No further affidavit <em>shall be received in evidence</em> without the leave of the Court.” (emphasis added). The formulation in r 89(3) goes so far as to make leave of court a precondition to the <em>admissibility</em> of any additional affidavit on top of the parties’ respective AM affidavits into <em>evidence</em>. This provision can be arguably said to extend as far as to regulate the evidential status of any affidavit filed that is not an AM affidavit of the parties and the <em>identity</em> of the deponent of affidavits. The High Court in <em>WMM</em> was thus quite right when it held that r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 requires parties to obtain leave of court before non-party affidavits may be filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     Rule 42, in contradistinction to r 89(3) of the FJR 2014, is drafted differently. First of all, any parallel wording to that found in r 89(3) is found <em>only</em> in r 42(4) and that this is a provision that, strictly speaking, applies to the filing of affidavits in <em>originating summonses</em>. Further, the language used is framed in a non-mandatory manner: “the plaintiff or applicant <em>may</em> not file a further affidavit without leave.” (emphasis added) and appears, at least based on the express wording, to speak only to the <em>filing</em> of such affidavits, not their reception into evidence. In any event and more critically, when we look at the provisions in r 42 that are applicable to <em>summonses</em>, <em>ie</em>, r 42(1), 42(2), 42(3)(b) or 42(5) of the FJR 2014), none of these provisions even contain express language suggesting that plaintiff or applicant may not file a further affidavit without the leave of the Court (as is provided for in the case of originating summonses). Indeed, this is an argument forming a core part of the plaintiff counsel, Mr Leong Zhen Yang’s submissions before me at the second tranche of the hearing on 26 June 2025. This argument further weakens the defendant’s case for the restrictive reading which is based on an analogy with the High Court’s decision in <em>WMM</em> and its reading of r 89(3), a provision which does contain such language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The silence in the text regarding whether leave of court is required for the purposes of affidavits filed in <em>summonses</em> suggests that a lighter touch may have been adopted for summonses than for AM proceedings. Such silence mirrors the position in summary judgment applications under O 14 of the ROC 2014, which are themselves commenced by way of summons. Order 14 rule 2(1) requires the plaintiff to support the summons with “an affidavit or affidavits”, while O 14 r 2(6) imposes a leave filter only after each side has filed their affidavits as prescribed in the three stages (supporting affidavit (O 14 r 2(2)), reply affidavit (O 14 r 2(3) and (4)) and finally, final reply affidavit (O 14 r 2(5)) under O 14 r 2. Commentary on O 14 explains that there is no limit on the number of supporting affidavits precisely because no single person would have knowledge of all the facts: see <em>Singapore Civil Procedure 2020</em> vol 1 (Chua Lee Ming gen ed) (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2020) at para 14/2/6, citing <em>Chong Yeo</em>. In other words, this provision recognises that interlocutory evidence may often come from multiple witnesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     A comparison with trial procedure also reinforces the point. At trial, parties are not confined to affidavits sworn by themselves; they are left unrestricted to file (and exchange) factual witness affidavits (or Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief) originating from persons with relevant evidence, subject only to the opposing party’s right to seek the exclusion of such evidence where, for example, the prejudicial effect outweighs probative value or the evidence is otherwise inadmissible under any ground recognised at law. The permissive reading of r 42, to my mind, better aligns the procedure applicable to summons (and also perhaps, originating summonses) with that already established for the trial process.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     To build on the point that a lighter touch may have been adopted for summonses with regards to the filing of affidavits, I observe that such applications deal primarily with procedural matters which must often be heard on short notice (<em>eg</em>, Mareva injunctions), and crucially, produce findings which are typically interlocutory in nature (and hence are strictly speaking, non-binding) on the eventual hearing of the merits. To accommodate this unique nature of interlocutory applications (which includes summonses, and in some cases, even originating summonses provided that they do not determine the rights of parties: for the test to determine an “interlocutory proceeding”, see <em>MUI Bank Bhd v Alkner Investments Pte Ltd</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/41523-M.xml')\">[1990] 3 MLJ 385</a> at 387–388; <em>“The Ocean Jade”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0354.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 354</a> at [86]; see also <em>Gobi a/l Avedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25180-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 883</a> at [56] (“<b><em>Gobi a/l Avedian</em></b>”) at [61], where an originating summons (<em>vide</em> HC/OS 111/2020) involving an application for leave to commence judicial review was treated as “interlocutory proceedings”), the law takes a relaxed approach to the evidence admitted in this context by providing that hearsay is admissible at the interlocutory stage such that affidavits may even be sworn on the information or belief of a deponent provided the deponent discloses the grounds and source of said information or belief: see r 646(2) of the FJR 2014; see also O 41 r 5(2) of the ROC 2014; <em>State Bank of India Singapore v Rainforest Trading Ltd and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2011] SGHC 0182.xml')\">[2011] SGHC 182</a> at [43]; <em>Gobi a/l Avedian</em> at [56]. If the law is prepared to accept such hearsay evidence from a deponent lacking personal knowledge of matters, it would be quite inconsistent and also against judicial economy to insist that a deponent with first-hand knowledge of matters of concern to an interlocutory application (even if it may be a child) can only be heard after a <em>separate</em> leave application and potentially, another contested hearing has been heard.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     In a related vein, I highlight Part 3 of the FJR 2014 which mandates a judge-led approach in family proceedings aimed at the just, expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings. While not quite enshrined at the same level of O 3 r 1 of the Rules of Court 2021 (“<b>ROC 2021</b>”) under which the “Ideals” such as expeditious proceedings (O 3 r 1(2)(<em>b</em>)) serve as the lodestars in the interpretation of those Rules, I highlight that a permissive reading of r 42 of the FJR 2014 nonetheless aligns with the judge-led approach which enlivens the approach to family proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In connection with the point on the expeditious and economical disposal of proceedings, there is an article published on the Singapore Law Gazette by then-District Judge and Deputy Registrar of the Family and Juvenile Justice Division of the Subordinate Courts, Ms Regina Ow-Chang Yee Lin, “The Women’s Charter (Matrimonial Proceedings) Amendment Rules 2013” (https://v1.lawgazette.com.sg/2013-12/919.htm). While not qualifying as a preparatory material of the MPR, this academic commentary sheds light on the intent behind the introduction of the r 5A of the MPR (from which r 42 of FJR 2014) was derived to “allow the summons to be managed more effectively and be heard expeditiously”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Affidavit in Support to be Filed with the Originating Summons/Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A new rule r 5A(1) has been introduced to provide that the affidavit in support of an originating summons or summons must be filed at the time of the filing of the originating summons or the summons. Filing the affidavit in support together with the application reduces any delay in fixing the case for either pre-trial conference or hearing. Adjournments which may be occasioned by the late filing of the affidavit in support will be reduced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Changes Affecting Timeframes</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Timeframe to File the Affidavit in Reply to an Originating Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">A new r 5A(2)(<em>a</em>) prescribes the timeframe of 21 days for the defendant to file and serve the affidavits in reply to an originating summons. No further affidavit is to be filed without leave of Court. This mirrors the procedure in the ROC which is applicable to an originating summons filed under the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Mental Capacity Act (which are also heard in the Family Court). This consistent approach for all types of originating summons in the Family Court will make it easier for lawyers and parties. </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b><em>Timeframe to File the Affidavit in Reply to a Summons</em></b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Most of the summonses under the MPR are for applications for interim maintenance, interim custody, care and control of children and for the variation of ancillary orders. These applications touch on the financial needs of parties and the welfare of children. As such, they are best dealt with expeditiously without any delay.</em> Pursuant to new r 5A(2)(b), the respondent to a summons has to file an affidavit in reply within 14 days after service of the affidavit in support. Thus when the summons is discussed at the Case Conference (fixed within four weeks from the filing of the summons), the positions of both parties are laid out in their respective affidavits and the Court may assist the parties in discussing settlement of the disputed issues. <em>This will also allow the summons to be managed more effectively and be heard expeditiously.</em> Any affidavits to be filed subsequently require the leave of Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     I make three observations. First, the commentary above appears to support the analysis that r 5A of the MPR goes towards only the <em>timeframe</em> of the affidavits to be filed. This is consistent with a reading that the rule governs only the <em>sequence</em> of affidavits to be filed, and the time mandated for doing so. Second, the point that “Any affidavits to be filed <em>subsequently</em> require the leave of Court.” (emphasis added), also lends support to the permissive reading of r 5A (and in turn r 42) in that only affidavits filed past the sequence delineated by the rule would be caught by the leave requirement. Third, the observation that of applications touch on the financial needs of parties and the welfare of <em>children</em> and that they are best dealt with expeditiously without any delay. A permissive reading of r 42 better serves this imperative. It allows evidence from non-parties (especially children) with direct personal knowledge to be placed directly before the court. This avoids satellite litigation over leave applications that would arise under the restrictive reading of r 42, enabling the court to deal with the application expeditiously.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Seen in the wider jurisprudential context as set out above, I am of the view that reading r 42 of the FJR 2014 permissively would better align family law procedure with the approach taken in the wider civil procedure practice (or at the very least, summary judgment summonses). There is sense in allowing a litigant to choose the deponent best placed to prove the relevant facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     It may be plausibly argued that O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 permits the filing of multiple affidavits (including those of non-parties) <em>only</em> because the express text of those rules provides for this through its reference to “affidavits” in the <em>plural</em> (“affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>”). By parity of reasoning, an argument may thus be advanced as the defendant’s counsel, Mr Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma, had done at the hearing before me, that the omission of “affidavits” in the plural under r 42 of the FJR 2014 means that only <em>one</em> affidavit (<em>ie</em>, the parties’ affidavit) may be filed at each sequence of the process. To assist the reader, I reproduce O 14 r 2 of the ROC 2014 which reference “affidavits” in the plural:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Manner in which application under Rule 1 must be made (O.14, r.2)</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">2.—(1)    An application under Rule 1 must be made by summons supported by an affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    The summons and the supporting affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> must be filed at the same time, and must be served on the defendant within 3 days from the date of filing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    The defendant on whom the summons and the supporting affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> have been served may show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    If the defendant wishes to show cause against the plaintiff’s application by affidavit, he must file and serve his affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> on the plaintiff within 14 days after service of the plaintiff’s summons and affidavit or affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(5)    The plaintiff must, if he wishes to reply to the defendant’s affidavit or <em>affidavits</em>, file and serve his affidavit or affidavits on the defendant within 14 days after service of the defendant’s affidavit or affidavits.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(<em>6</em>)     <em>No further affidavit shall be received in evidence without the leave of the Court.</em> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    Where a party files or serves an affidavit beyond the period of time specified in this Rule, the Court may make such order as to costs against that party as it considers fit.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(8)    An affidavit or <em>affidavits</em> for the purpose of this Rule must contain all necessary evidence in support of or in opposition (as the case may be) to the claim, or a part of the claim, to which the application relates, and unless the Court otherwise directs, may contain statements of information or belief with the sources and grounds thereof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     However, I do not consider the absence of any reference to “affidavits” in the plural in r 42 to be fatal to the permissive reading. Again, r 42 merely governs the <em>sequence</em> of affidavits to be filed by the respective parties (see above at [(4)]) and does not speak to the identity of the deponent of any affidavit relied on. Further, and in any event, s 9 of the IA provides that “words in the singular include the plural”. The reference to “affidavit” in the singular thus does not preclude the same from being read in its plural sense.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     Notwithstanding my finding above that the permissive reading should apply to r 42 of the FJR 2014, I remain cognisant of the concerns raised by the defendant’s counsel regarding the hesitance which the court must have in admitting children’s affidavit given concerns over whether such evidence have been given voluntarily. As to this, I observe that even after a further affidavit (in the form of the children’s affidavit, as in this case) has been admitted filed, the court is not obliged to lend full weight to its contents. In <em>Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services Pte Ltd v The “Bunga Melati 5”</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2010] SGHC 0193.xml')\">[2010] SGHC 193</a> at [65], the learned AR observed that a court is not required to treat every affidavit filed as true and at face value. The court may in appropriate circumstances reject the evidence contained therein, even in the context of an interlocutory application, citing <em>Paclantic v Moscow Narodny Bank</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/15203-E-M.xml')\">[1983] 1 WLR 1063</a> at 1067. Likewise, the High Court in <em>Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2003] 3 SLR(R) 0008.xml')\">[2003] 3 SLR(R) 8</a> at [24] approved the proposition from <em>Microsoft Corporation v Electro-Wide Limited</em> [1997] FSR 580 (at 594) that a court is not obliged to suspend its critical faculties merely because a defence (in the context of a summary judgment application) is supported by a sworn affidavit. Where the affidavit is contradicted by contemporaneous documents or is inherently implausible, the court must find so. Indeed, even for cases before the family courts, r 647 of the FJR 2014 vests the court with the power to strike out affidavits or any part of the same which are “irrelevant”. These authorities underscore that admitting a child’s affidavit under the permissive reading of r 42 does not compel the court to accept its contents uncritically. The defendant’s concerns regarding the reliability of the children’s affidavit filed in this case can therefore be addressed through the application of these principles. There is no need to adopt a restrictive reading of r 42 of the FJR 2014, which would require leave of court (and possibly a contested hearing) for <em>all</em> non-party affidavits filed for the purposes of summonses (or perhaps, originating summonses).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Finally, insofar as the defendant suggests that only <em>children’s</em> affidavit should be given special treatment due to the dangers of relying on such evidence, I do not agree that any interpretation of r 42 can be contingent on the nature of affidavit concerned. The dispute over r 42 is a binary one: <em>does the provision permit an applicant to file a non-party affidavit without leave of court (the permissive reading) or does it forbid any such filing without leave of court (the restrictive reading)?</em> That fork operates at a broad level of procedure concerning whether a non-party affidavit may be filed without leave of court; it does not operate at the level which touches on the specific identity of said non-party. To this, nothing in the text of r 42 suggests that its operation turns on whether the deponent is a child or any other possible categories of witnesses such as parents, teachers, an account, or a solicitor. Again (as stated above at [16]), r 42 is silent as to the identity of the deponent of affidavits filed. Accordingly, whichever construction one adopts of r 42, it must apply across the board to all non-party affidavits. The decision in <em>WWM</em> illustrates this. Although the affidavits at issue there happened to originate from children, the High Court had held (at [4]) that in the AM context, r 89(3) only envisages the AM affidavits of the parties themselves. “Any others” (which I highlight includes both children’s and even non-children’s affidavits) may only be filed with the leave of court. This appears also to have been the case pitched by the wife’s counsel in that case as the argument advanced there was that “that on a purposive interpretation of r 89 FJR, no leave is required for <em>non-parties</em> to file affidavits in court.” (emphasis added).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     For the reasons above, I hold that the permissive reading applies to r 42 of the FJR 2014. No leave of court is required before a party may file a non-party (including children’s affidavit) for the purposes of a summons application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     One may then ask: <em>what is the position for whether leave of court is required for the filing of non-party affidavits for summonses under the new regime under the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024 (“</em><b><em>FJ(G)R 2024</em></b><em>”)?</em> This will be an important issue for a future court to decide as most summonses proceeding through the courts will be under the new regime. As this issue is not necessary for my decision, I would only point out that P 5 r 15(7) of the FJ(G)R 2024 which governs summonses in originating applications appears to substantially adopt the same language used in r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 in providing that “Except in a special case, no further affidavit is to be received in evidence without the Court’s approval.” I leave the question of whether this mandatory language means that a similar interpretation adopted for r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 should also apply to summonses filed under the FJ(G)R 2024 regime, namely, that the filing of non-party affidavits requires the leave of court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-4\">(5)   No determination on the issue of whether the leave granted by the AR on 3 April 2025 covered the children’s affidavit filed</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Before leaving this section and for completeness, I address the defendant’s argument that they had, in any event, obtained such leave at the case conference on 3 April 2025 for the filing of the children’s affidavit. While the AR had granted leave for the filing of a reply affidavit, I note that there is a dispute as to whether such leave was <em>restricted</em> to the plaintiff’s filing of a reply affidavit or whether it takes into account the filing of the children’s affidavit. Both the plaintiff and defendant’s counsel take diametrically opposing positions based on their own notes of the case conference of 3 April 2025 as to whether or not such leave was granted in view of the plaintiff’s intention to file children’s affidavit. Without the formal record of proceedings tendered into evidence before me, I am unable to determine this issue and would say no more on this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The portions of the affidavits of Tammy filed on 18 April 2025 and Cassandra filed on 17 April 2025 which are irrelevant to SUM 578 are to be struck out</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Notwithstanding that I’ve found that leave of court is not required for a party to file non-party affidavits for the purposes of a summons application, as I have noted above at [30], the court retains the power to reject affidavits that are irrelevant. I would exercise this power in this instance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     The crux of SUM 578 is a confined procedural question: <em>should the 16 January 2025 affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra remain on the record for the AM hearing?</em> That enquiry can be answered by a straightforward application of r 89(3) of the FJR 2014 and the test of relevance and necessity as laid down in <em>WWM</em> to the impugned affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra dated 16 January 2025. In my view, the parties’ own affidavits and written submissions are more than sufficient for the court to make a finding on this limited issue. No additional affidavits deposed by the children is required for the Court to decide that issue.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Viewed against that yardstick, not only are the two children’s affidavits filed in support of the plaintiff in SUM 578 (<em>ie</em>, Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April and Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025) <em>but also</em> the affidavit filed in support of the defendant by way of Nancy’s affidavit of 28 March 2025 are superfluous. To my mind, they merely echo or embellish assertions already set out in their parents’ affidavits and dwell largely on matters <em>tangential</em> to the issue in SUM 578. I refer to a few of such assertions to illustrate this:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <b>Cassandra’s affidavit</b>: “I have decided to live with my father because I am closer to him. I can see for myself that my father keeps the family environment stable and he has been the one supporting me in all areas of my life … I would like to continue to stay with my dad as he cares for us fully. He is always available to help and never ignores our phone calls or texts or argues or interferes with my friends.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span> This relates to Cassandra’s preference as to who she would like to stay with; a matter irrelevant to SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <b>Tammy’s affidavit</b>: “I would like to continue to stay with my dad as he makes sure we get regular meals. He cleans the house every day and cares for us in all areas of our lives. He is always available to help and never ignores our phone calls or texts or argues or interferes with my friends.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span> This also relates to Tammy’s preference as to who she would like to stay with which is irrelevant to SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_37-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <b>Nancy’s affidavit</b>: “My younger sister [Tammy] in her affidavit has stated that my mother was asleep when she was involved in an accident when scalding hot water was splashed all over her. This is not true. This is not true because I am a witness to the scalding episode involving [Tammy].”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> This relates to assertions made regarding the defendant’s caretaking of [Tammy] and is not for this Court’s determination in SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The above assertions in the Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits which bear on the questions of the parties’ indirect contributions are to be explored, if at all, at the substantive hearing of the AM rather than in the summons application in SUM 578. These assertions should have been left out of the affidavits filed for the purposes of SUM 578.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     I acknowledge that there are potentially <em>relevant</em> assertions in Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits, particularly where they talk about the <em>voluntariness</em> of their affidavits affirmed for the purposes of the AM proceedings and which therefore can assist this Court in the determination of SUM 578. These portions of the children’s affidavits assert that Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits affirmed for the purposes of the AM proceedings were either made <em>voluntarily<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></em> or <em>non-voluntarily</em> after having been coached by the plaintiff.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> In this regard, I note that no substantial supporting evidence by any of the children in support of these contrasting assertions and indeed, it is difficult to see how such evidence can be offered. This evidence may not be strictly necessary for the Court in determining SUM 578. This Court is capable of coming to a conclusion as to the issues engaged even <em>without</em> the benefit of Tammy, Cassandra or Nancy’s affidavits filed in SUM 578. Their admission complicates what is otherwise a straightforward interlocutory application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     Be that as it may, considering that these are relevant to SUM 578 and that the court’s powers of striking out does <em>not</em> appear to extend to striking out affidavits where they are not necessary (<em>cf</em> an application for leave for adduce further affidavit where the court considers whether an affidavit is relevant or necessary: <em>WMM</em> at [5]), I allow these portions of the affidavits to remain on the evidential record for the purposes of determining SUM 578. For avoidance of doubt, the following paragraphs of Tammy, Cassandra and Nancy’s affidavits are allowed to remain because they speak to the core issue in SUM 578, <em>ie</em>, the <em>voluntariness</em> of Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April 2025: Paras 1 to 7, 9 and 12.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025: Paras 1 to 8, 10, 13 and 16 to 18.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_40-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Nancy’s affidavit filed on 28 March 2025: Paras 1 to 3, 8, 9 and 15.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Finally, the defendant has relied on an alternative ground in the form of Rule 647 of the FJR 2014, which the defendant submits provides the court with the discretion to strike out documents that are “otherwise oppressive”. Rule 647 provides that the Court may order any matter, in an affidavit, which is “scandalous, irrelevant or otherwise oppressive” to be struck out. The defendant submits that in interpreting the scope of the oppression limb, reference to the parallel provision in O 9 r 16(4)(<em>a</em>) of the ROC 2021 is helpful. This rule provides that the Court may order any affidavit or other document filed in Court to be struck out or redacted on the ground that the party had no right to file the affidavit or document. I do not rule on whether the term “oppression” covers a situation where a party has filed an affidavit where he had no right to do so. Based on my finding above at [32] that no leave of court is required for the filing of non-party (including children’s) affidavits for summonses, the defendant’s argument cannot stand.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">SUM 578: Children’s affidavits sought to be adduced for AM proceedings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     I now deal with SUM 578. For avoidance of doubt, I deal with SUM 578 based on the following affidavits which remain on the record:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The plaintiff’s supporting affidavit in SUM 578 dated 14 March 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The defendant’s reply affidavit in SUM 578 dated 28 March 2025;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The plaintiff’s final reply affidavit in SUM 578 dated 17 April 2025; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_42-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The portions of Cassandra and Tammy’s affidavit filed on 17 and 18 April 2025 and Nancy’s affidavit filed on 28 March 2025 which remain on the record (see above at [40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     The key issue before me is whether Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits dated 16 January 2025 are relevant and necessary for the AM proceedings. This follows from <em>WWM</em>, which established that leave of court is required for the filing of children’s affidavit in AM proceedings and that relevance and necessity are the primary touchstones in determining whether to grant such leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     The defendant contends that these affidavits are tainted with “grave inaccuracies, involuntariness and intended to be self-serving”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> and that they are “not true and correct”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span> She points to various alleged discrepancies and inconsistencies in the affidavits to argue against their admission. However, with respect, the defendant’s submissions misconceive the proper inquiry at this stage. The question before me is not whether the affidavits are accurate or true. On the face of the affidavits, they have been properly affirmed with the Tammy and Cassandra appearing before the Commissioner for Oaths via a live video link. It is the function of a Commissioner for Oaths to verify that deponents understand the documents they are being deposed to: see <em>eg</em>, <em>Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore – Evidence</em> vol 10 and 10(2) <em>(LexisNexis, 2023 Reissue)</em> at para 120.489.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     If anything, the defendant’s dispute as to the <em>truth</em> of the assertions made in the children’s affidavits is a dispute to be adjudicated on by the judge hearing the AM proceedings. As to the concerns of inaccuracies, this also goes towards the weight to be accorded to these affidavits rather than their admissibility as evidence. It would be quite inappropriate at this interlocutory stage to conduct what would effectively be a mini trial on the truth of the children’s evidence. The proper approach is to allow the evidence to be admitted if it is <em>relevant and necessary</em>, leaving questions of credibility and weight to be determined at the substantive hearing where the full context can be properly examined. The questions to be answered are therefore:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_a\"></a>(a)     whether the evidence contained in the affidavits is <em>relevant</em> to the issues to be determined in the AM; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_45-p2_b\"></a>(b)     whether such evidence is <em>necessary</em> to assist the court in making those determinations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits filed on 16 January 2025 are relevant to the determination of the AM</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The defendant raises several arguments against the relevance and necessity of Tammy and Cassandra’s 16 January 2025 affidavits. In particular, she contends that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The children’s evidence would only be helpful for the periods of their teenage years (2017 to 2024 for Tammy and 2019 to 2024 for Cassandra), not the entirety of the parties’ 24 years of marriage.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The onus should be on the parties, not the children, to prove their respective cases regarding indirect contributions. The children’s evidence merely provides “additional support” to claims and rebuttals against factual allegations, similar to <em>WWM</em> where such evidence was found irrelevant and/or unnecessary.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_46-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Courts are generally slow to admit children’s evidence in issues not directly involving children, such as division of matrimonial assets.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     I find that Tammy’s and Cassandra’s evidence are relevant to the ancillary proceedings for several reasons. For one, the parties have taken drastically opposing positions regarding their respective roles and contributions over the marriage. The defendant claims she prioritised the children’s needs since their birth and that her life revolved around her family and children. Conversely, the plaintiff contends the defendant had minimal involvement in caregiving and household duties. The children’s evidence about the parties’ respective roles is highly relevant to testing the parties’ positions on their indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The defendant’s argument that the children can only give reliable evidence about their teenage years is unpersuasive. While memories of early childhood may understandably be less detailed, I find that the children would remain able to speak about the pattern of caregiving and household responsibilities they observed <em>throughout</em> their lives. At ages 20 and 18 respectively, they are mature enough to provide meaningful evidence about their lived experience with both parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Tammy and Cassandra’s affidavits filed on 16 January 2025 are necessary for the determination of the AM</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     On the question of necessity, I am satisfied that this is to be answered in the affirmative. The dispute about indirect contributions spans 24 years and relate primarily to one party’s words against the other. In this connection, the children are uniquely positioned as direct observers of the family dynamic and the parties’ respective roles. Their evidence is not merely “additional support” but provides independent first-hand testimony about matters that go to the heart of the ancillary issues. It is also not lost on me that the stark contrast between the parties’ positions makes independent evidence particularly valuable to the court’s assessment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The fact that Tammy and Cassandra are the parties’ <em>children</em> does not, by this fact alone, make their evidence of any less assistance to the court if it is both relevant and necessary. The defendant’s citation of academic commentary in the form of the late Ms Malathi Das’ article entitled “Court in the Crossfire — Children as Witnesses” which was published on the Singapore Law Gazette (Malathi Das, “Court in the Crossfire — Children as Witnesses” (https://v1.lawgazette.com.sg/2003-11/Nov03-feature.htm) is unpersuasive. The article urges caution but does not lay down any rule that children should generally be excluded from giving evidence (nor that their affidavits may only be filed with the court’s leave). Indeed, the prevailing law adopts a more calibrated approach: where, and how, a child’s evidence should be received in court and taken into account depends on a multitude of factors to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This, I explain below at [52]–[53]. In this connection, the defendant has relied on s 120 of the Evidence Act 1893 (2020 Rev Ed) (“<b>EA</b>”)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> which provides:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Who may testify</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">120.  All persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <em>Explanation</em>.—A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless he or she is prevented by his or her lunacy from understanding the questions put to him or her and giving rational answers to them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     This appears to be a suggestion that Tammy and Cassandra are “prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions” whether by reason of their purportedly “tender years” or any other cause of the same kind. There is no merit to this submission. Assuming that the provision is applicable, Tammy was 20 years old and Cassandra, 18 years old, at the time their affidavits were affirmed. No specific age limit is defined in the EA as for what tender years mean and indeed, I do not think any hard and fast rule applies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     While there has been one case in <em>Ng Kwee Piow v R</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/33909-M.xml')\">[1960] MLJ 278</a> in which a 17 or 18-year old person was found to be of insufficient intelligence to be sworn or affirmed, I do not consider this case to go so far as to lay down the ages of 17 and 18 as the bright line below which a person is to be considered incapable of providing their evidence. Even if this was the implication of this case, the antiquity of this decision leaves room to doubt whether this remains an acceptable proposition. The modern approach in the law towards the assessment of the evidence of children has taken on a more nuanced complexion. I refer by way of illustration to the Court of Appeal’s approach towards children established in <em>Lee Kwang Peng v Public Prosecutor and another appeal</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1997] 2 SLR(R) 0569.xml')\">[1997] 2 SLR(R) 569</a> at [67] that such evidence should not be discounted as a matter of course but is to be scrutinised for the purpose of ascertaining its reliability and whether there is a need to rely on supporting evidence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     More recently and more directly in the context of proceedings before the family court, I refer also to <em>WKM v WKN</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/31403-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 158</a>, one of the rare cases which have leapfrogged the Appellate Division to reach the apex court for a matter arising from the family courts. In dealing with the care and control and access arrangement of the child concerned, the Court of Appeal held (at [60]) that reliance that a judge places on the content of a judicial interview depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. Some of the factors relevant include the age, emotional and intellectual maturity of the child, the relationship of the child’s parents, whether there were concerns of alienating conduct and whether there was existing material before the court, such as child welfare reports. The long and short of what this case illustrates is this: there is no hard and fast rule against a court discounting a child’s views merely on account of their age. Ultimately, the test for a person to be found competent to testify is whether the individual is capable of understanding questions put to him and of giving rational answers. There is no question that Tammy and Cassandra fulfil this threshold. Their evidence relates strictly to the parties’ involvement in the household. Matters include whether the plaintiff took care of the children, the housework and the defendant’s involvement in the children’s lives more generally. These are matters which children of 18 and 20 years of age would be perfectly able to take a rational view on. I accordingly do not agree with the defendant’s reliance on s 120 of the EA.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     As to the defendant’s firm belief that “[Tammy] has been coached to make her affidavit” and that she “suggest[s] that the Court interview her”,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> this is something I leave to the defendant to take up before the AM judge.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     For the reasons above, I find that the January 2025 affidavits of Tammy and Cassandra meet the threshold requirements of relevance and necessity for their filing to be regularised for the purposes of the AM proceedings. I allow prayers 3 and 4 of SUM 1003. For the record, I make no orders as to Prayers 1 and 2 as they concern a <em>blanket</em> request for leave to adduce the evidence of Tammy and Cassandra in the AM proceedings. Without having sight of the evidence sought to be adduced, I refrain from granting such leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     For the reasons above, I <b>partially allow</b> the defendant’s application in SUM 1003 by striking out the irrelevant portions of Tammy’s affidavit filed on 18 April, Cassandra’s affidavit filed on 17 April 2025 and <em>also</em> Nancy’s affidavit of 28 March 2025 (see above at [37]–[40]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     For SUM 578, I <b>allow</b> this application on the terms as I have stated above (see above at [55]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     The parties are to file submissions on costs, if they are unable to agree on the same, within 14 days.

time-barred</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I begin by noting that the Applicant had sought to recover maintenance arrears of about 10½ years (in MSS 160) and about eight years (in MSS 1057).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       According to s 91R(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“<b>Charter</b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Maintenance arrears are not recoverable in any proceedings ... from the defaulter if the amount accrued due <em>more than 3 years</em> before the commencement of the proceedings, unless —</p> <p

proceedings, MSS 160 and MSS 1057 are not time-barred. I say this because the Applicant had applied to enforce the relevant maintenance order way before the time-bar kicked in: s 91R(4)(a). Arising from these applications, warrants to arrest were issued in 2017 and 2020 against the Respondent for failing to attend court for these proceedings. Since 2020, the Applicant had been checking with the authorities annually on the status of her enforcement applications.

According to this provision –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The amount that the court may order in an attachment of earnings order is a sum that seems <em>reasonable</em> to the court, after taking into account the resources and needs <em>of the respondent</em> and the needs <em>of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     I make a few observations regarding s 91C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The provision requires a court to consider the following factors when determining the appropriate amount to attach:</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_i\"></a>(i)       The respondent’s resources,</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       His personal expenses, and</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_a-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       “[T]he needs of persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Regarding (iii) above, it appears from the phrase “persons for whom the respondent must or reasonably should provide” that the class of persons coming within s 91C is restricted to the respondent’s dependants.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_c\"></a>(c)     When a respondent claims that he needs to cover the expenses of his/her dependants, it is necessary to scrutinise such claims carefully. This is because the efficacy of attachment of earnings orders can be undermined if respondents can easily avoid them by making bare claims that they have insufficient earnings for attachment due to their financial commitments to other persons. The relevant inquiries can include the following: Is the dependant gainfully employed? What is the dependant’s earning capacity? Does the dependant have other sources of income apart from the respondent? Are the dependant’s expenses – for which the respondent is providing – reasonable?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_10-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Finally, in determining what is a “reasonable” amount of earnings to attach, it is necessary to <em>balance</em> three competing interests – those of (i) the party seeking to enforce a maintenance order, (ii) the respondent, and (iii) his/her dependants. One consequence of this balancing exercise is that the amount of earnings that is eventually attached may be lower than the amount of maintenance sought to be recovered.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">MEO report</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Having set out the relevant considerations for determining the amount of the earnings to attach, I will now apply them to the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     In undertaking this determination, I am greatly assisted by the maintenance enforcement officer’s report (dated 8 May 2025) (“<b>Report</b>”).

According to him, he gives an allowance of $250 to $300 per month to her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> When questioned by the Applicant as to why he chose to give allowance to his mother but not a single cent to their children, the Respondent gave two reasons. <em>First</em>, his mother had given birth to him. <em>Second</em>, he claimed that the Applicant had prevented him from seeing the children unless he paid maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I cannot accept the Respondent’s reasons as amounting to sufficient cause for breaching the maintenance orders. It bears highlighting that he has the burden to show sufficient cause. In this regard –</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Even if the Applicant had disallowed the Respondent from seeing their children unless he paid maintenance, this does not justify his refusal to pay child maintenance. This is because as their parent, he has both a legal and moral duty to maintain them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, the Respondent has failed to provide evidence (i) on what his mother’s monthly expenses are, and (ii) why his allowance of $250 to $300 is necessary to tide her over every month. The Respondent has thus failed to explain why he cannot give a lesser amount of allowance to his mother – so that he could give the balance to his children with the Applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Finally, it bears noting that the Respondent has three siblings whom his mother can turn to for financial support. (On the other hand, the Applicant had to support three young children on her own for the past eight years.)</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     Given the above, I find that the Respondent can reduce his monthly allowance to his mother to $100 – so that the balance $150 to $200 can be given to his children with the Applicant for their maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s son with the current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     According to the Respondent, he pays $345/month towards the maintenance of his one-year-old child with his current wife.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> This amount is used to pay for the child’s diapers ($65/month) and milk powder ($280/month).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I find these expenses to be reasonable and accordingly deduct them from the Respondent’s disposal income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s stepson</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The Respondent currently pays a total of $279/month towards the maintenance of his current wife’s son with another man. This consists of (a) the child’s handphone bill ($29/month), (b) his school transport ($50), and (c) school allowance ($200).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     During the trial, I could sense the Applicant’s bitterness when she asked the Respondent why he was maintaining the child of another man when he had not been maintaining their own children. The Respondent did not give an adequate response to this question.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I note that it is not necessary <em>at this moment</em> for the Respondent to reduce his financial support to his stepson to pay the maintenance for his children with the Applicant. This is because there is sufficient balance from his monthly disposal income to support both his stepson and the Applicant’s children: see [26] below. Accordingly, I allowed $279/month to be deducted from his disposable income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Respondent’s current wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Finally, the Respondent pays for his current wife’s phone bill at $35/month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span> He explained that his wife – who was an infant-care teacher – is now a homemaker taking care of their one-year-old child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     Given that the wife is currently unemployed, and the small amount involved ($35/month), I find it appropriate to deduct this amount from the Respondent’s disposal income. It bears noting however that where the financial need arises, the Respondent and his current wife must be prepared for the latter to return to the workforce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Summing up</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     To sum-up, based on the Respondent’s income and financial commitments, I find that the Applicant’s request to attach a sum of $1,500/month from his earnings is reasonable.</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"8.28%\"><col width=\"54.82%\"><col

His ex-Wife (“XNZ”) is the respondent. This was the essence of XNY’s complaint: that despite his attempts to move on in life after the divorce, XNZ had engaged in a pattern of conduct that caused him no small amount of stress and grief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       I heard the trial on 7 May 2025 and allowed the XNY’s application in SSP 374. In addition to ordering the PPO sought, I also made a no contact order (“NCO”) and called for a preliminary assessment report (“PAR”) (see s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       These are the reasons for my decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The New Family Violence Regime </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       It is useful, at this juncture, to briefly canvass the new family violence provisions that came into force on 2 January 2025. These legislative amendments came in the wake of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Family Violence (the “Taskforce Report”) and were meant to strengthen legislation to “better protect survivors and enhance the rehabilitation and accountability of perpetrators”: Second Reading of the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and other Matters) (Amendment) Bill (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (4 February 2023) vol 95) (Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling) (“Second Reading”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The most significant of these amendments comes in the form of the updated definitions of family violence. The previous definition of family violence had four limbs:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">“family violence” means the commission of any of the following acts:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    wilfully or knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family member in fear of hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought to have been known would result in hurt;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his or her will;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member,</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">but does not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way of correction towards a child below 21 years of age;</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Under the new legislative architecture, family violence has been defined in more granularity along the lines of physical, emotional or psychological, and sexual abuse. This change to the definition of family violence was also made to “align how abuse is defined in other acts such as the Child and Young Persons Act 1993 and the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018” (see Second Reading; for an example of how the definitions of “abuse” have been applied in the Vulnerable Adults Act 2018, see also <em>Re GEQ and another matter</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 376 at [26] where the court found that the respondent was guilty of “verbal, emotional or psychological abuse of” the vulnerable adult).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       Physical abuse is defined as (s 58B(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    “Physical abuse” —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    includes conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    causes, or threatens to cause, personal injury or physical pain to a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   threatens a person with the death or injury of the person; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    also includes wrongfully confining or restraining a person against the person’s will; but</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    does not include any force lawfully used —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(i)    in self-defence; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">(ii)   by way of correction towards a child below 18 years of age.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       As for sexual abuse, that is defined as (s 58B(3) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(3)    “Sexual abuse” includes conduct or behaviour that coerces, or attempts to coerce, a person to engage in sexual activity.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       Finally, emotional or psychological abuse is defined as (s 58B(4) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(4)    “Emotional or psychological abuse” means conduct or behaviour that —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    torments, intimidates, harasses or distresses a person; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    causes or may reasonably be expected to cause mental harm to a person, including thoughts of suicide or inflicting self-harm.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In addition, the new provisions also provide that abuse can either take the form of a single “instance of conduct or behaviour” or a “course of conduct of behaviour” (s 58B(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961). It also provides that the conduct or behaviour that amounts to abuse “need not be directed at the family member in question” but it has to be “capable of being seen, heard or otherwise perceived (directly or indirectly) by the family member in question” (s 58B(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961). The accompanying illustrations also provide guidance as to what constitutes physical, and emotional or psychological abuse:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"></p><div align=\"center\">Illustrations</div><p></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X spreads false rumours to third parties about X’s spouse being promiscuous. X’s spouse finds out about the rumours and is distressed. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against X’s spouse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    X is prone to smash furniture in X’s house when X is angry. This behaviour causes X’s child to be distressed and in fear of personal injury. X has committed physical abuse, as well as emotional or psychological abuse, against X’s child.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    X repeatedly makes demeaning comments to belittle and humiliate Y in front of their children. X threatens to stop giving Y a monthly allowance if Y contacts Y’s family or friends or seeks help. Y suffers mental harm as a result. X has committed emotional or psychological abuse against Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     Notwithstanding these changes to the definitions of family violence, the two requirements that an applicant must establish, on a balance of probabilities, to succeed in their application (s 60A(1) of the Women’s Charter 1961), remains broadly the same. <b><em>First</em></b>, it must be shown that that the respondent has committed or is likely to commit family violence against the person sought to be protected. <b><em>Second</em></b>, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     Apart from ordering a PPO, the court can also grant additional orders. Under the previous family violence provisions, the court could only grant, in addition to a PPO, a domestic exclusion order (“DEO”) and a counselling order (“CGO”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     With the amendments to the family violence provisions of the Women’s Charter, the suite of orders that the court may grant in addition to a PPO has been greatly expanded. For instance, apart from a DEO and a CGO, the court may also grant a stay-away order (“SAO”), a no-contact order (“NCO”) (see s 60B of the Women’s Charter 1961) and a mandatory treatment order (“MTO”) (see s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">XNY's application for a PPO</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     XNY’s complaint was that he had suffered emotional and psychological abuse because of XNZ’s behaviour. He complained of the following incidents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The first incident took place on 14 February 2025. XNZ had, in the days prior, applied for a PPO against him. On the 14<sup>th</sup> of February, XNY received the summons to attend court. He says this caused “significant emotional and mental stress” on him and his current wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The second incident took place on 3 March 2012. XNZ had taken out a PPO application against XNY. Consequently, XNY received a summons to attend court. XNY said that the complaint was false. He could not have committed family violence against XNZ as he was on reservist training. Although the case was dropped, XNY says he suffered “significant stress and fear of [XNZ]’s unpredictable behaviour and random baseless accusations”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The third incident occurred on 2 April 2021. XNY received an unsolicited message on Whatsapp. XNZ said that she had slept with another man. She sent him a picture of an unknown man sleeping in her bed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     The fourth incident took place sometime in April 2017. XNZ had managed to track down and get in contact with XNY’s former boss (“C”). She told C that XNY and his mother had been using black magic on C’s wife. The use of such black magic, according to XNZ, caused C’s wife to fall ill. C subsequently contacted XNY to inform him about this incident. In XNY’s words:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">XNY:  And that’s where she contacted and just out rightly told told him that, you know, she has, like, a kind some kind of a secret and she would like to tell him now that, “Your wife actually passed away”, due to the doing of my late mum. And that’s how I got to know because my ex-boss was shocked to hear such a thing. I think he contacted me in a way to demand to know whether it’s true or not. Because, you know, it’s very sensitive, like, he just lost a wife, and then somebody just, out of nowhere, come and say such a thing, where I’ve not met her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Back then, it happened maybe 10 years or 11 years ago. And after I explained and I was shocked to hear that, of course, and I…and I have to explain, of course, you know you know, my mum is quite is very religious person and we come from a reputable family…And, of course, we are religious, and we will not do condone such a thing that what she mentioned.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">And I was lucky enough that my ex-boss, like, convinced that, of course, she’s…she’s trying to pull a false one. Whatever her motive of doing that, we are not sure.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ had committed family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     I found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence on XNY – specifically, that her conduct or behaviour had harassed and/or distressed XNY (see s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I arrive at this conclusion based on the incident which had taken place in April 2017 (see above at [18]). XNY’s account of the incident was corroborated by C who testified at the trial before me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     C confirmed that XNZ had indeed contacted him and told him that XNY and XNY’s mother had put a black magic spell on his wife, and that had caused her to become bedridden. In his words:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2\" frame=\"none\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"13.96%\"><col width=\"86.04%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">At the time, my wife was---2017, my wife had already been bedridden for a good almost 8 years, alright? When she was bed…the time when she first got bedridden, [XNY] was still working with me. So that’s how---that---that---that’s how probably the knowledge of---of my wife being bedridden came out. And we were having very long hours, okay, when were at [XXX], and this was back in 07, 08, 09, 2010. It was very long hours. I was covering long hours as well. So apparently, the caller told me that [XNY] was not happy with spending so many hours at work, bearing in mind that this was 2017, 7 years after we parted ways in terms of our---our---our working together. So caller told me that the reason why my wife was bedridden was because [XNY] and his mother put a black magic spell on---on my wife, which I---I found very strange, but I didn’t want to say too much. I said, “Okay, noted. Thank you very much”, and along those lines. Conversation lasted maybe about 5 minutes or so. I was a little bit busy, and I did not really want to entertain this call because I hardly know the caller. And I just didn’t want to pursue it further because it was very distressing for me. So after we hung up, because I had made this call on my mobile, the---the caller sent me a---a---a message to follow up on what she said, and that’s what I printed out. So at the time, I knew that [XNY] was not in Singapore, and I sent him a message, “Call me straightaway.” Because we---we belong to the same professional organisation, and he was representing the organisation in a congress overseas. So I knew he was out of town. So he called me while, I think, he was in Greece or <em>en route</em> from Berlin to Greece, and I told him about the whole thing. And that was where he told me that his uncle or---or some relative was also contacted along the same lines to---basically just to mention negative points about [XNY]. So I also asked him if he wanted to make a police report, because if he wanted to make a police report, I would also follow up with mine. But when he came back, he decided not to. </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Court:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Alright, [C], the caller in this case, could you tell me who was it?</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">C:</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">She identified herself as [XNZ], [XNY]’s ex-wife. That was how she identified herself, and that’s how I saved her number in my phone.</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     C also produced a text message from XNZ. In that text message, XNZ identifies herself and also states that XNY had performed black magic on C’s wife. XNZ goes on to state that XNY had done so to take revenge on C.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I found that XNZ had indeed contacted C, in this incident in 2017, to spread false rumours about XNY and his mother having performed black magic on C’s wife. That much was evident, not only from C’s testimony, but also the text message which C had produced.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     I also concluded that XNZ’s act of spreading such false rumours about XNY fell squarely within the definition of emotional or psychological abuse. It is clear from the words of s 58B(4) that whether a respondent’s conduct or behaviour amounts to emotional or psychological abuse is to be assessed with reference to the <b><em>impact</em></b> such conduct or behaviour has on the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     This is further reinforced by the explanatory statement contained in the Women’s Charter (Family Violence and Other Matters) (Amendment) Bill which states that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(iv)  the definition of emotional or psychological abuse <b><u>refers to conduct or behaviour that distresses an individual</u></b>, and not to conduct or behaviour that is offensive to an individual;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     As to the sort of conduct that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, one example may be found in Illustration (a) to s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961. Another example was also given by the Minister of State for Social and Family Development, Ms Sun Xueling in the Second Reading:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Stakeholders have shared situations where perpetrators threaten to withhold monthly allowance from their spouses, constantly call their spouses to check on their whereabouts and isolate them from their friends or family, including disallowing them to leave the house. If the spouses do not comply, they may be threatened by the perpetrator. These egregious forms of controlling behaviour – which falls within the definition of what some other jurisdictions call &quot;coercive control&quot; – can cause distress or mental harm to a survivor and would be considered emotional or psychological abuse under the new Bill.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     While such examples provide a useful illustration of the sort of conduct or behaviour that could constitute emotional and psychological abuse, it is important to not lose sight of the fact that an applicant must <b><em>prove</em></b> the impact of such conduct or behaviour. For example, if the allegation is that the conduct in question had either tormented, intimidated, harassed or distressed the person sought to be protected (to cite the words of s 58B(4)(<em>a</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961), the applicant bears the burden of proving this. That much is made clear by ss 103 and 104 of the Evidence Act 1893 which state:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>Burden of proof</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">103.—(1)    Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability, dependent on the existence of facts which the person asserts, must prove that those facts exist.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said that the burden of proof lies on that person.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A desires a court to give judgment that B shall be punished for a crime which A says B has committed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove that B has committed the crime.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A desires a court to give judgment that A is entitled to certain land in the possession of B by reason of facts which A asserts and which B denies to be true.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">A must prove the existence of those facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>On whom burden of proof lies</b> </p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">104.  The burden of proof in a suit or proceeding lies on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Illustrations</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    A sues B for land of which B is in possession, and which, as A asserts, was left to A by the will of C, B’s father.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, B would be entitled to possession.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on A.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    A sues B for money due on a bond.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">The execution of the bond is admitted, but B says that it was obtained by fraud, which A denies.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">If no evidence were given on either side, A would succeed as the bond is not disputed and the fraud is not proved.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Therefore the burden of proof is on B.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     In the present case, I found that XNY had indeed established that XNZ’s conduct had caused him distress. There were two factors which pointed me to this conclusion. First, I believed XNY’s account that he was staunchly religious, and in that vein, I inferred that such accusations must have distressed him greatly. Second, it was also clear to me from C’s testimony that the both of them shared a close relationship – this meant that XNY was also privy to C’s personal struggles, namely, that C’s wife was seriously ill and needed care. Further, XNY had evidently looked up to C as a mentor, and C clearly had high regard for XNY’s abilities.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Viewed against this backdrop, it is clear how XNZ’s actions of spreading these allegations of black magic would have distressed XNY. It could have potentially ruined XNY’s reputation and relationship with someone whom he was not only close with, but who he also considered a personal mentor.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     For completeness, I turn now to deal with one other aspect of XNY’s complaint – that XNZ filing a PPO against him on 13 February 2025 had amounted to emotional abuse. In his testimony, XNY described how he was “emotionally and mentally” stressed because he had been hauled back to court for something that he did not do.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     I do not consider that the stress which XNY had experienced as a result of XNZ taking out a PPO application against him could amount to emotional abuse. Parties are, after all, entitled to file their complaints, and there are safeguards to minimise the filing of frivolous or meritless complaints. PPO applications start life as a Magistrate’s Complaint, and if the judge hearing the complaint decides that if there is insufficient reason to proceed, the complaint may be dismissed: P 3 r 7(<em>c</em>) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024. To give a few examples, a complaint may be dismissed in the following cases:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Where it is plainly clear that the complaint is being made for a collateral purpose. It is, after all, well established that the bringing of an application for collateral purposes does amount to an abuse of process, and the court possesses the inherent power to “prevent an abuse of its processes”: <em>Ho Kiang Fah v Toh Buan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2009] 3 SLR(R) 0398.xml')\">[2009] 3 SLR(R) 398</a> at [8] and [23]; <em>Lai Shit Har and another v Lau Yu Man</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2008] 4 SLR(R) 0348.xml')\">[2008] 4 SLR(R) 348</a> at [22] citing <em>Chee Siok Chin v Minister for Home Affairs</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/9595-SSP-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582</a> at [34]; <em>Heng Joo See v Ho Pol Ling</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1993] 2 SLR(R) 0763.xml')\">[1993] 2 SLR(R) 763</a> at [21] (see Goh Yihan, “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent Powers of the Singapore Courts” (2011) Singapore Journal of Legal Studies 178 at p 207 citing <em>Emilia Shipping Inc. v State Enterprises for Pulp and Paper Industries</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0411.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 411</a> at [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Where the applicant has no standing to apply for the PPO (see s 60 read with s 58A of the Women’s Charter 1961).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_31-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Where it is clear that the complaint is bound to fail even if one assumes that all the facts complained of are indeed true (<em>ie</em>, where the incidents complained of clearly do not fall within the definitions of family violence as set out in s 58B of the Women’s Charter 1961, or where it is plainly not necessary to make the order for the protection or the personal safety of the person in question).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     However, the fact that a complaint is accepted does not mean that the allegations contained within it are true. All it means is that the judge hearing the complaint has, in their assessment, considered that there is sufficient merit to the complaint. The respondent has a right to be heard. To facilitate this, the summons will be served on the respondent. And while this may cause some stress, which was XNY’s experience in the present case, this is an unavoidable consequence of the applicable procedural rules that govern PPO applications.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">XNZ was likely to commit family violence on XNY</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     In addition to finding that XNZ had committed family violence on XNY, I also found that XNZ was <b><em>likely</em></b> to commit family violence on XNY, specifically, that she was likely to continue to cause emotional or psychological abuse to XNY. There were, in my judgment, five factors which spoke to this:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The incident which took place in April 2017 which, as I have found (above at [19] – [29]), did cause XNY distress and thus amounted to emotional and/or psychological abuse.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The incident in November 2021 where she had texted XNY to say that she was sleeping with a man. XNY had exhibited the message from XNZ.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span> It showed a picture of an unknown man in a bed followed by a text: “[XNY], I sleep with a man.”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_c\"></a>(c)     XNY also testified that XNZ had called him when she was warded at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) and asked him to visit her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In this vein, there is also evidence that XNZ has a psychiatric condition for which she had been receiving treatment at IMH. XNZ had produced invoices from IMH which spoke to the treatment she was receiving from the psychiatrists as well as the medications which she had been prescribed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_33-p2_e\"></a>(e)     XNZ’s filing of the PPO applications against XNY, first, back in 2011, and subsequently in 2025. There are also the police reports which XNZ had filed against XNY. She alleged that she had seen XNY in the public areas that she frequents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     Taken together, these five points demonstrated a clear pattern of conduct on XNZ’s part. Despite XNY having resolved to go his own separate way after their divorce, XNZ continued to harass him. This ranged from contacting his former boss to sending him unsolicited text messages about her sleeping with another man.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     To be clear, XNZ’s pattern of conduct did not appear to be a campaign of harassment which she had consciously mounted against XNY as part of a vendetta that she had against him. There was nothing on the evidence to suggest that this was indeed the case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     There was, however, evidence to show that XNZ was not well. She was seeking treatment from IMH for an undisclosed psychiatric condition. That XNZ was not well was also clear from her testimony where she described how she would regularly dream of XNY and his family members,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span> and how she would see XNY in places that she frequented which led her to believe that A was following her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">It was necessary to grant the PPO </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     Having found that XNZ had indeed committed family violence, and was also likely to commit family violence, I turn now to consider the necessity of ordering a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The previous family violence provisions provided that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The court may, upon satisfaction on a balance of probabilities that family violence has been committed or is likely to be committed against a family member and <b>that it is necessary for the </b><b><u>protection </u></b><b>of the family member</b>, make a protection order restraining the person against whom the order is made from using family violence against the family member.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     In contrast, the newly enacted s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 makes it clear that the applicant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that the protection order is necessary for the protection or personal safety of the person sought to be protected. The legislative changes thus appear to have altered the necessity requirement by stipulating that a PPO may also be ordered if it is necessary for the <em>personal safety</em> of the person sought to be protected.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     This must be the case because while the word “protection” is conceivably wide enough to cover the ambit of “personal safety”, it is a well-established principle that because Parliament “shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”, the court should “endeavour to give significant to every word in an enactment”: <em>Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/21018-SSP.xml')\">[2017] 2 SLR 850</a> at [38] citing <em>JD Ltd v Comptroller of Income Tax</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/50060-M.xml')\">[2006] 1 SLR 484</a> at [43]; <em>Shanmugam Manohar v Attorney-General and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/25741-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 3 SLR 600</a> at [25]; <em>WCG v WCH</em> [2024] SLR(FC) 45 at [19]; <em>EQ Capital Investments Ltd v Sunbreeze Group Investments Ltd and others</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20810-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHCR 15</a> at [30] citing <em>Shell Eastern Petroleum Pte Ltd v Chief Assessor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1998] 3 SLR(R) 0874.xml')\">[1998] 3 SLR(R) 874</a> at [12]. The word “protection” must, therefore, have a different meaning from the phrase “personal safety”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     As to what “protection” and “personal safety” means, no mention is made in the Second Reading of what these terms mean, and exactly what the scope of each was meant to cover.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     That being said, I am of the view that “personal safety” has a broader scope than “protection”. For one, it is clear that the legislative amendments were made with a view to strengthening the measures available to those who have suffered from family violence. For example, the Taskforce Report had recommended:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Recommendation 11B: Amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make additional types of orders to ensure the safety of the survivors of violence, including non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">92.    Under the Women’s Charter, the Court may grant a DEO to perpetrators of family violence in addition to a PPO. This DEO will require the perpetrator to be excluded from part of or the entire family home to better ensure the safety of the family violence survivor. However, under the Vulnerable Adults Act, there are further provisions for the Court to grant other types of orders in addition to the protection order to better protect the survivor of violence. These include orders prohibiting the respondent (i.e. the person whom the protection order was made against) from visiting or communicating with the applicant, or from entering or remaining in an area outside the applicant’s place of residence or any other place frequented by the applicant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">93.    The Taskforce recommends that <b>the Government amend the Women’s Charter to specifically empower the Courts to make </b><b><em><u>additional </u></em></b><b>types of orders, such as the above-mentioned non-visitation, non-communication, and non-access orders</b>, <b><em><u>to better ensure the safety of the person who applied for a PPO</u></em></b>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     These recommendations from the Taskforce Report were indeed adopted, and have found expression in the new provisions which empower the court to make a SAO or NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) and s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Following from this, I consider that the notion of “protection” would only be confined to matters which directly impact an individual’s physical and mental state whereas the notion of “personal safety” must necessarily extend to, and encompass, an individual’s environment and their living circumstances that has an impact on their well-being. It is for this reason that the court now has the additional powers to grant a SAO or an NCO – both these orders go further than a PPO in that they severely limit any possible interactions between a respondent and the person protected by a PPO (“Y”). This ensures that Y has an environment in which they can enjoy a normalcy of life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     Having dealt with the definitions of “protection” and “personal safety”, I turn now to address two other related points of law.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     The first is whether “or”, as is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, is to be read conjunctively or disjunctively. This point arises because s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) states that a PPO may only be ordered if it is necessary for the protection <b><em><u>or</u></em></b> personal safety of Y.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The plain and ordinary meaning of “or” produces a disjunctive result – however, in the context of statutory interpretation, “or” may be read conjunctively in order to give effect to the intention of Parliament”: <em>Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/53560-M.xml')\">[2007] SGHC 123</a> at [68] – [72]; <em>Peh Hai Yam v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/20194-SSP.xml')\">[2017] SGHC 69</a> at [65].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     In the present case, given my observations above on Parliament’s intent to broaden the scope of protections available to those who have suffered family violence, and the difference in the scope of what “protection” and “personal safety” means, I do not think that “or”, as it is used in s 60A(1)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961 should be read conjunctively.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The second is the requirement of the requirement of necessity. I consider that the key inquiry here must involve a risk assessment. The court considers the “likelihood of the respondent committing family violence against” the person sought to be protected: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [19] – [20]. It is only in cases where the court has assessed there to be a sufficiently high risk of family violence being committed in the future, that a PPO will be necessary. After all, there are criminal consequences that follow from the breach of a PPO, and “ordering one is not a decision that a court would take lightly”: <em>XIO v XIP</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32867-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 18</a> at [5] citing <em>UNQ v UNR</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/25291-SSP.xml')\">[2020] SGHCF 21</a> at [28].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     In this vein, the court can also consider whether the PPO is necessary to deter family violence – this was a point noted in <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [23]:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">23    Finally, it is also relevant to consider whether there is a need for a PPO to deter future family violence. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    The possibility of arrest and being investigated by the Police can be a powerful deterrent against the commission of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    However, such a possibility may not be available if the offence arising from such violence is a “non-arrestable offence” in law. Examples include family violence which involve (i) assault / using criminal force under s 352 and (ii) voluntarily causing hurt under s 323 of the Penal Code 1871. What this means is that the perpetrators of such offences cannot be arrested without a warrant.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    A PPO can address this issue. This is because the breach of a PPO is itself an arrestable offence: s 65(11) of the Charter. Thus, a respondent who voluntarily causes hurt to an applicant after the latter has been given a PPO may be arrested for breaching the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     As to the indicators which speak to the likelihood of family violence being committed, they include, <em>inter alia</em>, unresolved causes of family violence and whether there would be continued future interactions between the parties: <em>XFL v XFM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32471-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 103</a> at [21].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     In the present case, I found that it was indeed necessary to order the PPO for XNY’s personal safety. It was clear to me that the present case was one where XNZ’s conduct had impacted XNY’s living circumstances and thus exacted a toll on him. The way XNZ had acted was clearly affecting XNY’s personal life, as well as his professional relationships. I accepted XNY’s evidence that XNZ’s conduct had indeed taken an emotional toll on him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> Despite XNY’s best attempts to cut off any and all contact with B, she still found ways to get in touch with XNY and his colleagues. This resulted in an unenviable situation where XNY had to deal with the fallout from XNZ’s actions, with the clearest example of this being the false rumours XNZ had spread to C about XNY and his mother having performed black magic (see above at [18] – [23]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     The evidence also showed that XNZ’s conduct was not a one-off event, but rather, a consistent pattern of behaviour over a period of several years. This suggested that there was some unresolved issue on XNZ’s part, and that this was the root cause of her continuing to act out in this manner against XNY. Until that issue was identified and resolved, it was likely that XNZ’s pattern of behaviour would continue into the future.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     Having decided to grant XNY’s application for a PPO, I also considered it necessary for his personal safety to order a NCO: s 60B(2)(<em>c</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. It was clear that XNY wanted nothing more to do with XNZ. The NCO was needed to ensure that XNY could put his past with XNZ behind him, and continue with his life, without living in anxiety that XNZ would try to make contact with him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     That being said, and for completeness, I add that having ordered a NCO, I did not find it necessary to order a SAO. Such an order would require XNZ to stay away from XNY’s home or any other place frequented by XNY: s 60B(2)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter. In order for XNZ to comply with a SAO, the addresses of XNY’s home, and other areas frequented by him would have to be disclosed to XNZ. I considered that doing so would frustrate the very purpose of making a NCO – and that was to lay down, and enforce a clear separation between XNY and XNZ, and to ensure that there was no further opportunity by which XNZ could continue to try and maintain contact with XNY.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_56\"></a>56     Given that the evidence before me indicated that XNZ was receiving treatment from IMH, I also saw fit to order that a PAR be produced pursuant to s 60F of the Women’s Charter 1961. While the court is empowered to make a MTO, there are several steps that must be taken before such an order may be made.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     First, the court must have reasonable grounds to believe that: <b>a)</b> the respondent is likely to be suffering from a psychiatric condition and <b>b)</b> that psychiatric condition is likely to be a contributing factor for the respondent’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against them in the first place: s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. To that end, the court <b><em>may</em></b>, before deciding if such reasonable grounds exist, call for a PAR: s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     Notably, the language used in s 60F(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 suggests that it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR, and that the decision to call for a PAR lies solely within the court’s discretion: see also s 60F(8) of the Women’s Charter which states that there is no appeal against “any decision of the court to call for or not to call for a” PAR. One reason why it is not mandatory for the court to call for a PAR is that, in some cases, there may already be evidence before the court which establishes the requirements set out in s 60F(5) of the Women’s Charter 1961. Such evidence could take the form of an expert opinion (see generally P. 10 of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024, and in particular, P. 10 r. 3(1) which stipulates that leave of court must be obtained before expert evidence may be adduced).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Second, once the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it <b><em>must</em></b> call for a formal assessment report (“FAR”). The MTO can only be granted if the FAR certifies all the following matters (s 60F(16) of the Women’s Charter 1961):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(a)    X is suffering from a psychiatric condition;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(b)    the psychiatric condition is a contributing factor for X’s conduct or behaviour that was the basis for making the protection order against X;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(c)    the psychiatric condition is susceptible to treatment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(d)    X is suitable for the treatment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     In the present case, and given the available evidence before me, I deemed it necessary to call for a PAR to assist me in ascertaining whether there were reasonable grounds to believe that XNZ had a psychiatric condition which was a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour that was the basis for granting the PPO. As I had noted, above at ([53]), XNZ’s conduct was clearly due to some unresolved issue on her part. And while that unresolved issue could likely be a result of a psychiatric condition, the evidence before me only suggested a correlation between the psychiatric condition and XNZ’s behaviour towards XNY. It did not suggest, or establish, a causative link (<em>ie</em>, that her psychiatric condition was likely a contributing factor for her conduct or behaviour).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Conclusion</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_61\"></a>61     To sum up, I allowed XNY’s application for a PPO in SSP 374. In addition, I also ordered a NCO, and called for a PAR.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_62\"></a>62     As for costs, XNY asked for $1000 in costs to “act as a deterrent”. In response, XNZ said that she was unemployed and could “maybe pay only $500”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     Given that XNY did succeed in his application, he is, as a starting point, entitled to costs: P. 22 r. 3(2) of the Family Justice (General) Rules 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     An order of costs, however, does have practical implications. For example, in the context of divorce proceedings, it has been noted that an order of costs may only serve to “aggravate the acrimony between the parties”: <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a> at [32]. In other words, a costs order may also negatively affect the state of the relationship between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     One other practical implication insofar as costs are concerned is that details would have to be provided in order for payment to be made. For this to happen, there must necessarily be correspondence between the parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     In the present case, I considered that the circumstances warranted a departure from this starting point. Ordering costs would, in my judgment, frustrate the very goal for which I had ordered the PPO and NCO (see above at [55]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     To be clear, I must emphasise that I am not laying down a bright line rule that if a NCO is ordered, the court will necessarily make no order as to costs.

Since then, there have been protracted proceedings before the Court. Shortly after a case conference on 23 October 2024 and before the 1<sup>st</sup> hearing of the ancillary matters (AMs) on 19 December 2024, the Husband filed an application for a personal protection order (PPO) on behalf of the three (3) children of the marriage, C1 (14 years old), C2 (10 years old) and C3 (7 years old) on 4 November 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The PPO application was heard on 23 January 2025 (with written submissions filed on 17 April 2025) and dismissed on 8 May 2025.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> The 2<sup>nd</sup> hearing for the AMs, specifically the custody, care and control of and access to the children, was fixed on the same day i.e. 8 May 2025. Counsel for the Husband sought an adjournment, communicating the Husband’s hope and wish for reconciliation with the Wife. Given the lengthy course of proceedings, counsel for the Wife objected to the adjournment. I stood the matter down for counsel for the Wife to confirm with his client that there is no possibility of reconciliation. After speaking with the Wife, counsel confirmed that his client was firmly against any reconciliation and wished to proceed with the divorce to its conclusion. I proceeded to hear the AMs and now make my orders.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Background and History of the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Parties were married on 25 March 2010. Interim judgment was granted on 7 September 2022 based on the Parties’ respective claim and counterclaim of unreasonable behaviour on the part of the other Party. The effective length of the marriage is about 12.5 years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Both the Wife and the Husband had filed applications for interim orders in these proceedings. Since July 2022, the Wife has interim care and control over C2 and C3, while the Husband has interim care and control of C1. The background and context as to why such orders were made were set out in a separate judgment dismissing the Husband’s PPO application and shall not be repeated (see <em>XMB v XMA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33229-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 52</a>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       Under two interim maintenance orders, the Husband is to pay the Wife:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $250 per month for October and November 2023 and $1,000 per month with effect from 8 December 2023 as her maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_5-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $670 per month as maintenance for C2 ($380) and C3 ($290) with effect from 11 February 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       There were also backdated maintenance ordered to account for the failure and neglect to pay maintenance before the interim maintenance orders were made. At the hearing on 8 May 2022, counsel for the Wife informed that the Husband has yet to make a single payment of maintenance to the Wife and the arrears are standing at $44,500 (as of May 2025).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issues for determination</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The issues before the Court are as follows: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Custody, care and control of and access to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Division of matrimonial assets;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Maintenance for the Wife;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Maintenance for the children; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Affidavits filed by the Parties</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The following are the affidavits filed by the Parties for the hearing of the AMs: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"28.5342931413717%\"><col width=\"35.9128174365127%\"><col width=\"35.5528894221156%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Affidavit</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Wife’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Reference to Husband’s Affidavits (if any)</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Affidavit of Assets and Means </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA1</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA1</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">2<sup>nd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA2</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>HA2</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">3<sup>rd</sup> Affidavit</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>WA3</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>-</b> </p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       There are numerous other affidavits filed by the Parties for their applications for interim orders and for the Wife’s application for discovery and interrogatories. The Parties also filed affidavits to explain the circumstances leading to the cessation of access sometime from February/March 2024 onwards. Where necessary, these affidavits will be referred to by the date on which they are filed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     The Husband’s father, Mr [T] filed an affidavit in support of the Husband’s case that he had given loans to the Husband totalling $275,000 over the span of more than 10 years and that upon the sale of a commercial property (referred to in this judgment as the “ST property”) in September 2022, he had been repaid the sum of $235,000 from the sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 1: Custody, care and control of and access to the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Parties are agreed that there should be joint custody of the children, save that the Wife sought to have the final say on the children’s educational matters. They are also each seeking care and control of all three (3) children. While the Husband proposes reasonable access (in the event that he has care and control of the children), the Wife’s position is that the Husband should have supervised access.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     A Child Representative (CR) was appointed based on the Parties’ agreement. Mr Yap Teong Liang, who was the appointed CR, submitted his report to Court on 9 December 2024. This was done after a prolonged delay in which he attempted to arrange for interviews with the Husband and C1 to no avail between the period from 22 August to 8 November 2024. So as not to delay the matter any further, the Court had directed the CR to submit his report, notwithstanding that he had not been able to interview the Husband and C1.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The CR was of the view that there should be joint custody of the children. Although the Wife sought to have the final say in the children’s education up till tertiary education, the CR took the view that excluding the Husband from educational decisions is not in the best interest of the children and potentially sends a wrong signal to the other parent, which discourages co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_2\" id=\"Ftn_2_1\"><sup>[note: 2]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The CR recommended for the Wife to have care and control of all 3 children. The events since July 2021 to date had shown that the split care and control arrangements have not worked well in the children’s interest. There has been a lack of co-operation between the parents, and access has not been at a level where the siblings have regular contact time with each other.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The CR also recommended reasonable unsupervised access with detailed proposals set out in his report and other orders such as: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_a\"></a>(a)     An order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent to the children;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_15-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Counselling orders for the parents and the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     To ease the transition of the care and control to the Wife and the access arrangements, the CR is of the view that it would be helpful for the children to have a session with a Court Family Specialist to explain the orders that the Court would eventually make. Further consideration may also be given for the appointment of a Parenting Co-ordinator to ease the transition of access for the children.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_4\" id=\"Ftn_4_1\"><sup>[note: 4]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     At the outset, I wish to state that I agree with the CR and the Parties themselves that the siblings should not be separated. This is in line with the case authorities that where there are siblings involved, it is generally desirable to have them stay together (see for example, <em>Wong Phila Mae v Shaw Harold</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[1991] 1 SLR(R) 0680.xml')\">[1991] 1 SLR(R) 680</a>). The split care and control arrangements, which were intended to be interim in nature, have indeed not worked well for the children. Because of the deep level of mistrust between their parents arising from the incidents in February/March 2024, the siblings have had no opportunity to interact with one another for more than 1 year and this has worked against their welfare.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     From the CR’s report, it is clear that C2 and C3 are doing well under the Wife’s care and they share a warm and loving relationship with her. It is important to note particularly that in the CR’s interactions with C2 and C3, he did not observe or note any adverse comments made by C2 or C3 against the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_5\" id=\"Ftn_5_1\"><sup>[note: 5]</sup></a></span> In my view, this shows that the Wife had not triangulated C2 and C3 in her deep conflict with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The same cannot be said for the Husband. Since C1 started living with his father, there has been an increasing strain in the relationship between him and his mother. C1 blocked the Wife on Whatsapp and refused meaningful communication and access with her. There was also increasing hostility on the part of C1 towards the Wife, with him calling her “evil” and a “liar” in his text messages<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_6\" id=\"Ftn_6_1\"><sup>[note: 6]</sup></a></span>. He also made alarming statements to her about making her life miserable and bringing her to hell with him if she comes back to the matrimonial home and takes his siblings away.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span> This contrasted with his more loving messages towards his mother and his willingness to go for access with her at the beginning of his time staying with the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In <em>ABW v ABV</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2014] SGHC 0029.xml')\">[2014] SGHC 29</a>, it was stated by the High Court (at [29]) that: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[29] Having said that, it is clear that switching care and control is a remedy that can be adopted if a judge finds that the parent having care and control has been either deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between the child and the other parent. This remedy would be most suitable in a situation in which the child begins to show animosity towards a parent with whom he previously had a loving relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     Although this is not a case of reversing final orders on care and control, I find the passage helpful to determine who should be granted final care and control of C1. In the present case, the Husband had either been deliberately or unconsciously interfering with the bond between C1 and the Wife such that C1 now views the Wife negatively and puts the blame on her entirely for leaving the Husband and breaking apart the family. If the care and control arrangements during the interim period (which had gone on far longer than anticipated due to the delay in proceedings that are largely caused by the Husband having at least 8 different sets of counsel and harbouring hopes of reconciliation) are allowed to perpetuate, C1 is at great risk of losing one of the most important human relationships i.e. that of mother and son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I am of the view that it is in the best interests of all 3 children to be placed under the care and control of the Wife and I so order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     The Wife and C1 would require a time for rebuilding their relationship without interference from the Husband and to this end, I am of the view that it would be helpful for there to be tiered access between the Husband and C1 in the following manner: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Phase 1: No access in the first 3 weeks from the time of handover<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Phase 2: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days for a period of 4 weeks;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Phase 3: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and supervised visitation for a period of 8 weeks (or more, if recommended by the relevant case worker);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     Phase 4: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Phase 5: Video access for 20 minutes on alternate days and fixed access on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     The Husband shall have video access for 20 minutes on alternate days to C2 and C3 and fixed access to C2 and C3 on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for 8 weeks and thereafter on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the physical access is not to commence until the supervised visitation sessions for the Husband and C1 have been completed and there has been some rebuilding of trust between the parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     The Parties and the children shall also be ordered to undergo counselling. C1, in particular, would require counselling to understand that there is no need for him to undertake the burden of aligning with his father in his parents’ dispute and for him to accept and come to terms with their marital breakdown. The parents would also need counselling to repair the trust between them and to learn how to co-parent moving forward. As recommended by the CR, I shall also order that neither parent shall speak ill of or disparage the other parent in the presence of the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     This leaves the relatively more straightforward issue of custody of the children. Although the Wife had sought for her to have the final say in the children’s educational matters, I see no reason to depart from precedents awarding joint custody to parents to promote co-parenting. Both Parties shall therefore have joint custody of all 3 children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     Before moving to the other issues, it remains for me to thank the CR, Mr Yap for his commendable efforts in trying to engage with the family, particularly with the Husband and C1 and producing a comprehensive report to assist the Court. Mr Yap has asked for the usual first-tier costs of $1,000 and I so order; the costs of $1,000 shall be borne by the Parties equally.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 2: Division of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The matrimonial pool</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     The Parties have three joint assets, namely the matrimonial home and two joint bank accounts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     I determine the size of the matrimonial pool as $<b>1,592,762.81</b> (not including assets of unknown value); the full list is found at [52]. I elaborate on the disputed assets below.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     The Wife took the view that the market value of the matrimonial home is $1,308,000. This was based on the latest available transacted prices as at the time WA3 was prepared for a unit in the same block of flats.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> The Husband’s valuation of the matrimonial home is $1,200,000 as at the time he filed HA1. In HA2, he stated that in reply to the Wife’s then valuation of $1,238,888 in WA2, he would rely on the latest resale flat prices for the value of the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     Given that the Wife’s figure of $1,308,000 is the most updated, I shall use this as the market value of the matrimonial home. The outstanding loan as of May 2025 is $390,212.36. The value of the matrimonial home to be added to the matrimonial pool is thus $917,787.64.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">QR Pte Ltd and ST Property<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     The Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Pte Ltd (“QR Company”). Notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar for the Husband to produce the necessary documents relating to this company, all that the Husband had produced is the ACRA profile dated 14 April 2022, an outdated profit and loss account statement for 2009 and 2010 and some bank statements of a Maybank account belonging to QR Company. The bank statements showed a balance of $247,424.42 as of 31 December 2022 with a depletion to $7,503.58 as of 30 April 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     Given the paucity of documents, the Wife originally indicated in her affidavit that she wished for $247,424.42 to be notionally ascribed as the value of QR Company and added to the matrimonial pool.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_13\" id=\"Ftn_13_1\"><sup>[note: 13]</sup></a></span> At the AM hearing on 19 December 2024, counsel for the Wife submitted that it is unclear whether the amount of $247,424.42 included the sale proceeds of a commercial property owned by QR Company (the “ST property”); to avoid double-accounting, he suggested that it may be fairer to add the latest and reduced amount in the bank account into the matrimonial pool and to account for the sale proceeds of the ST property separately. He further submitted that there is no other way to account for the value of QR Company, save to use the paid-up capital of $185,000 as reflected in the ACRA profile<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span>. As for the ST property, it was submitted that the Husband had sold it at below market value while the Parties are in the midst of divorce proceedings and that the Court should ascribe a value of $350,000 to that property.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     The Husband did not deny the sale of the ST property during the divorce proceedings but asserted that he had used its sale proceeds to repay his father a sum of $235,000 for loans that were extended to QR Company from time to time since 2010.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     Given that there is no documentation to show the extension of loans from the Husband’s father to QR Company and that the affidavit of the father, Mr [T] is self-serving in nature, I am minded to add the sale proceeds of the ST property into the matrimonial pool. As the Husband is the sole shareholder and director of QR Company<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_15\" id=\"Ftn_15_1\"><sup>[note: 15]</sup></a></span> which owns the ST property and he appears to be able to transfer the monies to his father at will, I am not convinced that the Husband should be allowed to hide behind the corporate veil.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     According to the EdgeProp document produced by the Wife<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_16\" id=\"Ftn_16_1\"><sup>[note: 16]</sup></a></span>, there was only one unit in ST sold in September 2022. The sale price was reflected as $270,000. In HA2, the Husband alleged that the ST property was sold in “September 2022 for $243,424.03”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> I am prepared to accept that there are costs and expenses involved in the sale and will therefore take $243,424.03 to be the net sale proceeds for the ST property. I am not convinced by the Wife’s argument that I ascribe $350,000 as the true market value of the ST property, given that there is only one other unit in ST sold for $350,000 in April 2022 and it is speculative as to whether the ST property belonging to QR Company would also have fetched the same price.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     The Husband asserted that the sum of $185,000 is the paid-up share capital and not the value of the company and objected to this characterisation.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> Since he had not produced <b><em>any documents</em></b> relating to the company which may show the true value of the company (especially given that it is a local company), it does not lie with him to object to this characterisation. The Court is left in the dark as to what the true value of the company is, and therefore has to agree with counsel for the Wife that there is no other objective way to put a value to the company. That being the case, I will add $185,000 notionally to the matrimonial pool as the value of QR Company. Since this $185,000 is supposed to represent the whole value of the company, I will not add the further bank balance of $7,503.58 in QR Company’s bank account to the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Mercedes Car</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     The Husband declared his ownership of a Mercedes car in HA1. This was bought on hire purchase after IJ was granted on 7 September 2022. In the circumstances, I would not consider the car as part of the matrimonial pool. Contrary to the Wife’s position, the car is not to be regarded as part of the matrimonial pool even though the car loan has since been fully discharged.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Withdrawals from the Husband’s UOB account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     The Wife took issue with the Husband’s withdrawals from his UOB personal account amounting to $164,421.47. She has tabulated a breakdown in WA2.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span> Her table included sums that do not appear significant i.e. $80, $137, $200 etc. While most of the individual amounts do not appear significant, there are some substantial withdrawals which I am of the view that the Husband should account for: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_a\"></a>(a)     24 September 2018 - $13,818.05</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_b\"></a>(b)     16 November 2018 - $21,516.68</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_39-p2_c\"></a>(c)     7 February 2019 - $21,840</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     The Husband did manage to show that he had deposited $21,840 into the joint account of the Parties on 7 February 2019 (the same day on which the sum was withdrawn from his UOB personal account).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> However, there was no documentary proof of how he had used the other two sums of $13,818.05 and $21,516.68 withdrawn in September and November 2018 respectively. Although his explanation was the same in respect of all three sums, only the sum of $21,840 was deposited in the joint account of the Parties. That being the case, I am of the view that he had not accounted satisfactorily for the other two sums and shall add the sum of $35,334.73 notionally back into the matrimonial pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     For completeness, the sum of $85,355.99 reflected in the table tabulated by the Wife (though substantial) appears to be an accumulation of unposted debits. It would not therefore be fair to the Husband for him to have to account for this sum.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Condominium in Malaysia </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband owns a condominium unit in Malaysia (referred to in this judgment as the “M Condo”). It is his case that this property was acquired before marriage and therefore not a matrimonial asset.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     However, it appears that although the M Condo is a pre-marital asset, it was enjoyed by the family as a holiday home or as a place to stay when they were in Kuala Lumpur. I am of the view that it falls within the definition of a matrimonial asset under section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (“WC”), that being:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties to the marriage ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     I am strengthened in the view that the M Condo is a matrimonial asset by the fact that the property is still subject to a loan and has not been fully paid off before the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_45\"></a>45     The Husband had listed this property for sale; the Wife took objection to this given that the divorce proceedings are not yet over. The Wife valued the property at RM600,000 while the Husband valued it at RM400,000. I shall use RM500,000 as the value of the M Condo given that it is the average of the two values submitted by the Parties and within the sales price range found in the PropertyGuru document tendered by the Husband.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_21\" id=\"Ftn_21_1\"><sup>[note: 21]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_46\"></a>46     There appears to be a debt due to the bank in the amount of RM439,080.63 in relation to the M Condo<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_22\" id=\"Ftn_22_1\"><sup>[note: 22]</sup></a></span>. As such, the net value (which is to be added into the matrimonial pool) is RM 60,919.37 (S$18,629.78 – using an exchange rate of S$1 = RM 3.27<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_23\" id=\"Ftn_23_1\"><sup>[note: 23]</sup></a></span>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The Husband’s other companies </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_47\"></a>47     The Husband’s other companies<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_24\" id=\"Ftn_24_1\"><sup>[note: 24]</sup></a></span> are:-</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_a\"></a>(a)     Re H – a company registered in the British Virgin Islands;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_b\"></a>(b)     AB Ltd – a forex brokerage company registered in Vanuatu;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_47-p2_c\"></a>(c)     CD Ltd – a holding company registered in Malaysia.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     The Husband claims that the above companies are no longer active. They have no monies and/or assets and are presently being wound up.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_25\" id=\"Ftn_25_1\"><sup>[note: 25]</sup></a></span> However, he has not produced any documents to substantiate his claims, notwithstanding the discovery order made by the Assistant Registrar on 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     The total value of these companies is therefore unknown.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alliance Bank account</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Alliance bank account was used by the Husband to pay the mortgage and other expenses for M Condo.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span> Similarly, no bank account statements were produced by the Husband, notwithstanding the discovery order of 5 July 2023.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Monies alleged to be taken by the Wife when she left the matrimonial home</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     The Husband alleged that the Wife took monies up to USD20,000 and S$30,000 from his safe when she left the matrimonial home.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> However, such an allegation was not substantiated by the Husband.

I also accept that before the Parties started living separately, he was also a relatively hands-on father to all the children.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_57\"></a>57     The Wife has been the primary caregiver of the children throughout the marriage, from their education to health and their general upbringing. She has also assisted the Husband in the operations of the companies he had set up. Although the Husband had attempted to downplay her role and her contributions towards his businesses, I accept that she had been involved significantly, based on her detailed accounts and knowledge of the businesses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_58\"></a>58     I also acknowledge that the Husband’s mother had helped towards the caregiving of the children and in fetching them back from the childcare centre, especially during the time when the Parties were still residing with the Husband’s parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_59\"></a>59     Given the length of the marriage and the factors above, I am of the view that a fair and proper ratio to be attributed for the Parties’ indirect contributions would be 60:40 in favour of the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Share of matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_60\"></a>60     Applying the structured approach laid down in <em>ANJ v ANK</em>, the Parties’ average percentages work out to be: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"47.8295659131826%\"><col width=\"25.3450690138028%\"><col width=\"26.8253650730146%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">1.

As the controlling mind of the companies which he had set up, he would have access to the financial documents to show the status and value of the companies. Yes, despite being ordered to produce such documents, he had failed, refused and/or neglected to do so to date. I note that nearly two years had elapsed since the order had been made. He had also not disclosed the bank statements for the Alliance Bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_63\"></a>63     I agree that an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband. Given that the values of such companies are unknown and there is no information as to the Alliance Bank account, the uplift approach should be applied: see W<em>RX v WRY and another matter</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32094-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 1 SLR 851</a> at [39]-[40]. I therefore grant an uplift of 5% to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Alleged debts/loans from friends and maintenance arrears</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_64\"></a>64     The Wife had asked for the debts/loans owed to her friends<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> to pay for the rent and living expenses of C2, C3 and herself (as a result of the Husband failing to pay maintenance since she moved out of the matrimonial home) to be taken into account in adjusting the final ratios. I decline to rely on her alleged debts/loans to adjust the final ratios; instead, I will look at the maintenance arrears owed under the interim maintenance orders to do so.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_65\"></a>65     As at the date of the Written Submissions, the Wife claimed that the Husband was in arrears of $19,000 for interim spousal maintenance and $16,750 for interim child maintenance. Counsel for the Wife informed at the hearing on 8 May 2025 that the Husband has continued not to pay under the interim maintenance orders since then.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_66\"></a>66     The total amount of arrears would therefore be $45,770 (including month of June 2025). This is equivalent to about 2.9% of the matrimonial pool. I grant the Wife an uplift of 2.9% to account for the maintenance arrears; no further arrears as of June 2025 shall be owing by the Husband to the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Final adjustment</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     The final ratio as adjusted between the Parties is therefore 48.4: 51.6 in favour of the Husband.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The Wife’s share of the matrimonial assets is thus $770,897.20 while that of the Husband is $821,865.61.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Consequential orders</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     The Wife had originally asked for the Husband’s share in the matrimonial home to be transferred to her. However, she now takes the view that she is unable to take over the Husband’s share and is applying for the matrimonial home to be sold in the open market.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     The Wife shall be at liberty to close both the joint accounts and retain the monies within. With these sums accounted for, the following will thus be each Party’s respective share in the matrimonial home: -</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col width=\"50%\"><col width=\"50%\"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Wife</b> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <b>Husband</b> </p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$686,309.66</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">$231,477.98</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"r\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">74.8%</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"center\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">25.2%</p> </td></tr></tbody></table><br clear=\"left\"><br clear=\"left\"> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The matrimonial home is to be sold on the open market within 6 months of the Final Judgment. The sale proceeds shall be divided in the following manner: 74.8% to the Wife and 25.2% to the Husband after the payment of the outstanding housing loan, the HDB resale levy (if any) and costs and expenses incidental and related to the sale of the property. The requisite CPF refunds in accordance with the applicable CPF Rules and Regulations to the Parties’ respective CPF accounts shall be made from the Parties’ respective share of the sale proceeds in the matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     Given the Husband’s conduct in these proceedings and his lingering hope of a reconciliation, the Wife is concerned that the Husband would delay the sale of the matrimonial home. I am minded to order that the Wife have sole conduct of the sale of the matrimonial home. She is to consult the Husband on the sale price of the matrimonial home but in the event of any disagreement, the Wife shall have the final say on the sale price. The mortgage payments shall be borne by the Parties equally before the matrimonial home is sold. The Registrar/Assistant Registrar of the Family Justice Courts shall also be empowered to execute, sign or endorse all necessary documents relating to the sale of the matrimonial home on behalf of either Party should either Party fail to do so within seven days of written request being made to the Party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     The Wife has asked for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in the interim period before the matrimonial home is sold. This is so that she can reside at the matrimonial home with the 3 children. Given that she has been granted the sole conduct of sale of the matrimonial property and the care and control of all the children, I do not think this is an unreasonable request. I therefore order that the Husband shall vacate the matrimonial home<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_30\" id=\"Ftn_30_1\"><sup>[note: 30]</sup></a></span> without C1 by 12 July 2025 giving the Wife exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home with the 3 children. I accept the suggestion of counsel for the Wife and order that the handover of C1 to the Wife shall be at the matrimonial home on the date set for the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home; this will cause the least disruption to C1, who can continue to stay at the matrimonial home until it is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     The Parties shall retain all other assets in their sole names.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 3: Maintenance for the Wife</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_75\"></a>75     The Wife has asked for continued spousal maintenance at $1,000 per month. However, considering her share of the matrimonial assets and her relatively young age, I am of the view that there should not be an order of maintenance that is aimed at creating a life-long dependency on the Husband (see for example, <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a>, at [31]). Instead, I shall award her a lump sum maintenance of $18,000 calculated by multiplying the monthly amount of $1,000 by a period of 18 months. This approach provides the Wife with transitional support while encouraging financial independence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_76\"></a>76     The Husband is to pay the Wife the lump sum maintenance from his share of the sale proceeds. If there is a shortfall, the Wife may enforce in the usual manner.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Issue 4: Maintenance for the children</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_77\"></a>77     The Wife submits the following breakdown of the children’s monthly expenses (with estimates provided for C1)<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_31\" id=\"Ftn_31_1\"><sup>[note:

update some of the expenses. Since C3 is now in Primary School, he would require pocket monies (at $50), school bus expenses (at $100) and ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20) but not milk powder or diapers anymore. There would also not be any child care fees but school fees for C3 (at $7).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_79\"></a>79     C2 will also not require milk powder but should have ad-hoc school activity expenses (at $20).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_80\"></a>80     For transport expenses, I am of the view that they should be pegged at the price of a monthly concessionary pass for primary and secondary students, that being $39 and $49 respectively.

Since I am ordering the Husband to vacate the matrimonial home in order for the Wife and the children to move in and for the mortgage loans to be paid equally in the meantime before the matrimonial home is sold, I am of the view that the accommodation expenses of the children should only be factored in as part of the maintenance order when the matrimonial home is sold.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_83\"></a>83     I turn now to the incomes and earning capacity of the Parties. I had earlier made a finding on the earning capacity of the Wife to be approximately between $2,200 to $2,700 per month in the interim maintenance application. Notwithstanding that the Wife had resigned from her employment as a Customer Service Officer and is currently self-employed with the assertion that her business has yet to generate sufficient profit to provide her with a sustainable income, I am of the view that for the purpose of this AM hearing, her earning capacity remains at between $2,200 and $2,700 per month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_84\"></a>84     The Wife submitted that the Husband had attempted to paint himself in poor financial straits, alleging that he owes debts to multiple parties (including his parents). The Wife disbelieved this and submitted that the Husband’s earning capacity is in the region of $12,000 per month. The nature of the business that the Husband was the controlling mind of were sophisticated in nature, operating in forex trade. Coupled with the extremely comfortable lifestyle that she and the children had enjoyed up until the breakdown of the marriage, it was her submission that the Husband was earning more than what he had disclosed in his affidavits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_32\" id=\"Ftn_32_1\"><sup>[note: 32]</sup></a></span> She also contended that the notices of assessment produced by the Husband for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2024 are not a truthful representation of the Husband’s actual income.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_85\"></a>85     The Husband averred that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic had resulted in failed business ventures and his loss of employment. He took on multiple jobs, including work as a safe distancing ambassador and a chef apprentice. He became an M &amp; E Assistant Project Manager in October 2021, earning a monthly salary of $4,000 for about 3 months before resigning to join another company as a Senior Engineer (Electrical) in January 2022. He was earning a monthly gross salary of $5,800 per month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_33\" id=\"Ftn_33_1\"><sup>[note: 33]</sup></a></span> He resigned from this job in February 2023 due to a dispute over project budget and liquidity issues in the company and claims to be unemployed ever since while receiving financial help from his parents. He had taken courses and sought employment opportunities, but none were successful.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_34\" id=\"Ftn_34_1\"><sup>[note: 34]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_86\"></a>86     The Husband’s last drawn salary was $5,800 per month. I accept that he was also a businessman and had a side income from his businesses. I am unable to make a finding that he had earned as much from his businesses as from his employment, given that a full-time job will require his time and resources. As such, I decline to accept the Wife’s submission that the Husband was earning in the region of $12,000 per month. In my view, although the Husband had claimed that he had no employment and no income since February 2023, the Court can take into account his earning capacity, which shall be assessed to be about $8,000 a month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_87\"></a>87     Given the differing levels of earning capacity, it would be fair for the Husband to bear 75% of the children’s expenses. I therefore order that the Husband pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children with effect from 12 July 2025: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,100 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $930 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_87-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $830 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_88\"></a>88     After the matrimonial home is sold, the Husband shall pay the Wife the following monthly maintenance for the children: -</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_a\"></a>(a)     $1,400 for C1;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_b\"></a>(b)     $1,270 for C2; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_88-p2_c\"></a>(c)     $1,170 for C3.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_89\"></a>89     All maintenance payments shall be deposited into the Wife’s designated bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_90\"></a>90     The Wife is represented by counsel assigned by the Legal Aid Bureau. Her counsel has indicated that he would be asking for costs on behalf of the Director of Legal Aid. Counsel for the Parties shall provide the Court with their submissions on costs (capped at 10 pages) within 10 working days from the date of this judgment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Concluding remarks</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_91\"></a>91     This set of divorce proceedings has gone on for far too long and both Parties had suffered immensely and gone through much emotional turmoil. It is regrettable that the Husband had not come to terms with the marital breakdown and at different junctures of the proceedings, his various counsel had raised his hope of reconciliation. The Husband had raged against the Court, counsel for the Wife and even his own former counsel for “speeding up” the divorce and breaking apart his family. I must emphasise to the Husband that no one involved in these proceedings takes any satisfaction in the dissolution of a marriage, and the protracted duration of these proceedings clearly demonstrates that there has been no undue haste.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_92\"></a>92     The profound mistrust between the Parties has had serious consequences, most notably on their children. For the past 1 ½ years, C1, C2 and C3 have been deprived of meaningful interaction with at least one parent. Moving forward, it is imperative that both Parties set aside their past grievances and work to overcome their conflicts, redirecting their energy towards rebuilding the parent-child relationships and the well-being of their children.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>The PPO which the Wife obtained for herself against the Husband by consent on 27 May 2021 remains in force.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [39]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [40]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [46]-[47]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>CR’s report, at [36]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>WA3, at [201] and Tab 54</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Wife’s affidavit filed on 19 March 2024, at [38]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See [73] on orders relating to the handover.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>WA3, pp 614-615</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>HA2, at [121]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>These are not the real names of the company or the property.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>HA2, p 184</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>WA2, at [15]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>HA1, p 170</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>WA2, at Tab 4</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>WA3, at Tab 44</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Page 33, para 120c.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Para 122 of HA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>See para 23</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Page 292 of HA2</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_21_1\" id=\"Ftn_21\">[note: 21]</a></sup>HA2, at page 245</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_22_1\" id=\"Ftn_22\">[note: 22]</a></sup>HA2, at page 246</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_23_1\" id=\"Ftn_23\">[note: 23]</a></sup>As at 8 May 2025</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_24_1\" id=\"Ftn_24\">[note: 24]</a></sup>Although the Wife asserted that there is another company (EF Pte Ltd) over which the Husband was the controlling mind, it was owned and operated by another individual.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_25_1\" id=\"Ftn_25\">[note: 25]</a></sup>HA1, at [9]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_26_1\" id=\"Ftn_26\">[note: 26]</a></sup>Husband’s affidavit filed on 9 June 2023</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_27_1\" id=\"Ftn_27\">[note: 27]</a></sup>HA2, at [18]</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_28_1\" id=\"Ftn_28\">[note: 28]</a></sup>Two of the investors had made statutory declarations (exhibited at Tabs 31 and 32 of WA3) on the circumstances under which the undertaking was signed.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_29_1\" id=\"Ftn_29\">[note: 29]</a></sup>Wife’s Written Submissions, at [140]-[142].

The applicant, who was 22 years old, is the daughter of the respondent. I shall refer to them as the “Daughter” and the “Father”. The Daughter was subject to family violence from the Mother as a child (though she said that the Father had also perpetrated violence against her, which he denied) and was placed in a safe home. The Daughter had then returned to stay in her parents’ home. However, the home was due to be sold and the Daughter would not have a place to stay. Further, she was attending university and had to work while studying to make ends meet. Against this background, she sought maintenance from her Father. I ordered the Father to pay her a modest sum of $500 a month.

Her big-ticket expenses were rent ($728), food and groceries ($550) and utilities ($160).<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_7\" id=\"Ftn_7_1\"><sup>[note: 7]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       The Father did not challenge the Daughter’s list of expenses. The Father also did not dispute that he had not been paying maintenance for the Daughter. His written case was that:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_8\" id=\"Ftn_8_1\"><sup>[note: 8]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Year 2015 [the Daughter] intent to leave parents’ house and wanted to stay with one of her friend who stay at CONDO, in order to enjoy freedom life.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">I did talk to her that time and told her that if she wants to do so she has to be adopted by the friend parents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">After that we will not [bear] any responsibility of her and she will not be entitle for any asset from parent.

However, a Court may order maintenance to be paid to a child above 21 in some specific circumstances, including when: “the child is or will be or … would be receiving instruction at an educational establishment …, whether or not while in gainful employment”: section 69(5)(<em>c</em>).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The quantum of reasonable maintenance is determined by having regard all relevant circumstances including the earning capacity of the parent and the standard of living enjoyed by the child: section 69(4).</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Whether the Father had failed to provide reasonable maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Father’s case appears to be that the Daughter had chosen to run away from home and in a sense “waived” her right to be maintained. Leaving aside the legal issue of whether a minor can waive her right to maintenance, the Father’s case is not even supported by the facts.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Father accepted that around 2015, the “following week” after the Daughter had purported run away, “Child protection officer then send her to child home and she continue to stay there until 2019”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> It is difficult to see why the Child Protection Service would place a child in care if the Daughter had run away to pursue “freedom”. That family violence was committed against the Daughter was confirmed by the PPO that was subsequently granted in her favour. Further, in Syariah Court proceedings, the Father had also filed an affidavit accusing the Daughter’s mother of physically abusing her.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> I thus did not hesitate to reject the Father’s argument had the Daughter had chosen to leave the family home and thus “waived” her right to maintenance”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     The Father also claimed that he was not working and thus could not afford to pay maintenance. It is trite that beyond the actual income of a parent, the earning capacity of a parent is also relevant: s 69(4)(<em>b</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961. His IRAS Notice of Assessment of Years 2023 showed that his employment income was $ 26,701, while for 2024 it was $28,918.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The Father explained that his job was project-based and the last project ended in December 2024.

From the beginning, she is with me.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     It is clear from the above that the Father did not think he should “torture” himself (<em>ie</em>, make the effort to find a new job) given his perceived personal grievances with the Daughter, whom he felt had left her. He also did not think that he should provide for the Daughter’s education, since it was her decision to pursue her studies. However, these are not legitimate reasons to refuse to pay maintenance. In any event, it was not even borne out by the evidence that the Daughter had abandoned him for “a better life”. As explained above, the Daughter had good reason to leave the house – she was the victim of family violence.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     Further, the Father was 53 years old and there was no evidence that he was medically unfit to work. I thus found that the Father failed to pay reasonable maintenance to the Daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Quantum of maintenance</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     I now turn to the sum of maintenance that the Father should be ordered to pay. The Father consistently maintained that he would not pay a single cent.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     As stated above, according to his most recent Notice of Assessment, his income exceeded $2,000 a month. The Daughter argued that he also earned rental income from properties in Bangladesh.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_17\" id=\"Ftn_17_1\"><sup>[note: 17]</sup></a></span> However, I found that she had not discharged her burden of proof.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     I note that the Father has declared in his statement that his own personal expenses amounted to $720 a month.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_18\" id=\"Ftn_18_1\"><sup>[note: 18]</sup></a></span> The Father also claimed that his other daughter (19 years old) whom he needed to maintain was physically and mentally ill. However, he accepted that he had not tendered evidence to substantiate this argument.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_19\" id=\"Ftn_19_1\"><sup>[note: 19]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     I had also considered whether the Daughter should also seek maintenance from her mother as well. To be clear, this argument was not raised by the Father but it was one which I thought was relevant. Nevertheless, the Father gave evidence that “I was the only single working person and maintaining the family.”<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_20\" id=\"Ftn_20_1\"><sup>[note: 20]</sup></a></span> The clear inference that the daughter’s mother was not working during the marriage and hence it would not be reasonable to expect her to pay maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     Thus, taking into account the Daughter’s needs, the Father’s ability to pay, including his personal expenses, earning capacity, past salary and his need to maintain another daughter, I found that it was reasonable for him to pay $500 a month in maintenance to the Daughter, and I so ordered. To be clear, it was not even necessary to scrutinise the Daughter’s list of expenses because $500 is already a very modest sum which would not even cover the Daughter’s accommodation expenses. It should also be noted that the Father’s obligation to pay would also cease by operation of law once the Daughter graduates. Considering all the circumstances, the sum ordered is, if anything, on the low side.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>PPO XXX/2020, granted in SS XXXX of 2020.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 2 and 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at pp 13 and 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_9_1\" id=\"Ftn_9\">[note: 9]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 1.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_10_1\" id=\"Ftn_10\">[note: 10]</a></sup>Father’s documents at p 31.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_11_1\" id=\"Ftn_11\">[note: 11]</a></sup>Daughter’s documents at p 90 (her Mother’s reply affidavit responding to the Father’s allegations).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_12_1\" id=\"Ftn_12\">[note: 12]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 23 and 24.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_13_1\" id=\"Ftn_13\">[note: 13]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at pp 14 and 15.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_14_1\" id=\"Ftn_14\">[note: 14]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 17.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_15_1\" id=\"Ftn_15\">[note: 15]</a></sup>Certified Transcript pp 18 to 21.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_16_1\" id=\"Ftn_16\">[note: 16]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 14.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_17_1\" id=\"Ftn_17\">[note: 17]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 8.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_18_1\" id=\"Ftn_18\">[note: 18]</a></sup>Father’s documents at pp 12 and 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_19_1\" id=\"Ftn_19\">[note: 19]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 13.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_20_1\" id=\"Ftn_20\">[note: 20]</a></sup>Certified Transcript at p 11.</p></div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Contested Divorce – Unreasonable behaviour – Section 95(3)(b) of the Women’s Charter 1961"],"date":"2025-06-13","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 3557 of 2022","title":"WPF v WPG","citation":"[2025] SGFC 67","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33403-SSP.xml","counsel":["Plaintiff-in-person","Defendant-in-person"],"timestamp":"2025-06-19T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kenneth Yap","html":"<root><head><title>WPF v WPG</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> WPF <em>v</em> WPG </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33403-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 67</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

The Husband, for his own reasons, contested the divorce strenuously. Much delay was caused by his purported heart condition, which saw repeated adjournments at first instance and on multiple appeals. As the Husband refused to proceed with cross-examination during the contested divorce hearing, I directed for an exchange of questions and answers to be conducted in writing, and proceeded to grant interim judgment on 5 March 2025. He now appeals against this decision.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Introduction</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       The parties were married in 2009. They have two children, a female aged 15 and a male aged 4 at the date on which I granted interim judgment in the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       The Wife claimed that the marriage had broken down irretrievably due to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. Some background to her prayers is provided to provide the context for the events that have transpired. In the Wife’s prayers for ancillary orders, she asks for sole custody of the children, with supervised access to the Husband every alternate Saturday. With regards to financial matters, she requests that the matrimonial home (a HDB flat in Ang Mo Kio) be transferred to her with no CPF refunds or cash consideration, and that their car be transferred to the Husband. No spousal or child maintenance was requested.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Wife’s Pleadings </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       The Wife pleaded the following particulars with regard to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     He had alleged she was having an affair and demanded a paternity test to prove that their younger child was his, which allegation was eventually proven to be wrong;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     He had applied domestic violence against her on 23 October 2019 (kicked her stomach and pushed her against the window), on 4 February 2021 (held her neck and pushed her against wall), and on 29 November 2021 when he attempted to break down the master bedroom door and subsequently destroyed two CCTVs in the master bedroom;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     He had harassed and humiliated her by entering into altercations before her friends and making a report against her to the hospital where she worked;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     He had pawned her jewellery and demanded money to pay for his car loan, and had failed to support the family since 2018;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_e\"></a>(e)     He had tried to forcefully take their young baby away on 1 February 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_f\"></a>(f)     He had continually threatened to report her to the authorities for alleged tax violations that he claimed would send her to prison.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       The Wife went on to provide particulars of how the marriage proceeded towards divorce. She had filed an application for a personal protection order (“PPO”) against the Husband in January 2022. The Husband then requested for two church members to help them mediate for reconciliation in the marriage on 5 February 2022. This however ended in failure and another altercation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the parties then signed a Mutual Agreement on 16 March 2022 witnessed by a solicitor, Mr Foo Ho Chew of H C Law Practice (“Mr Foo”). The Mutual Agreement is exhibited in the Wife’s supplementary Affidavit of Evidence-In-Chief (“AEIC”). Under the agreement, the Wife agreed to withdraw her PPO application, but if the Husband breached the good behaviour clauses contained therein, the divorce would proceed by consent with the HDB property being transferred to the Wife and her two children, in exchange for which she would compensate him $50,000, with no child maintenance required thereafter. On the basis of that agreement, Wife withdrew her PPO application SS 199/2022 on 22 March 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       However, the relationship broke down soon after with another altercation near the lawyer’s premises on 28 March 2022. The matter came to a head when the Husband allegedly breached isolation policy during the Covid-19 pandemic and came home despite being Covid-19 positive on 18 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       According to the Wife, parties have not been living together since October 2019. Wife asserts that Husband would only come home whenever he wants money, did not contribute financially and instead collected rental from the two rooms that were rented out in their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Husband’s Pleadings</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       In his defence, the Husband denies all incidents prior to 5 February 2022. He denied harassing her at her workplace thereafter and said he spoke to her boss only to ask for her withdrawal of the PPO application. As for the agreement on 16 March 2022, the Husband avers that the settlement agreement was only in relation to the PPO application. He also denies the various incidents thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     In sum, the Husband denies having acted unreasonably towards the Wife and asks for the divorce application to be dismissed with costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Striking Out Application</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The Husband’s next step in the proceedings was to file SUM 734/2023 to strike out the exhibited mutual agreement from the record. This was heard on 12 June 2023, and dismissed by Assistant Registrar (“AR”) Keziah Simon. He claimed the agreement was invalid as he had received no legal advice, its contents were not translated to him in Mandarin, and he had signed it under pressure due to the Wife’s pending PPO application. The AR found that this was not the correct forum to set aside the Mutual Agreement, as it was a private agreement that was not the subject of a court order. She also declined to strike out the Wife’s pleadings in respect of the Mutual Agreement, as it could not be said to prejudice the fair trial of the divorce. Its inclusion merely served to put the Husband on notice of the Wife’s case in relation to the divorce and ancillary matters. Accordingly, SUM 734/2023 was dismissed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     The Husband then filed RA 11/2023 against the dismissal, which was heard by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat. At the hearing, the Husband alleged that the Wife had conspired with his lawyer Mr Foo to deceive him into signing the Mutual Agreement. He also asked the court to rule on the reasonableness of the Mutual Agreement pursuant to section 96 of the Women’s Charter 1961. The court found his reliance on section 96 to be misplaced, as the issues raised in challenge related to the validity of the agreement. Accordingly, the court held that the question of reasonableness should only arise for consideration during the ancillary stage to the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     The Husband appealed further to the High Court in RAS XX/2023, but this was dismissed by Teh Hwee Hwee J on 29 July 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 9 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Following the Husband’s failed attempt to strike out the Mutual Agreement, the contested divorce proceeding was fixed for hearing on 13 August 2024. However, no substantive hearing was held until 9 September 2024, due to three adjournments that were granted on the basis of the Husband’s alleged heart condition. The details of these various adjournments can be found in my written grounds for the recusal application that the Husband was later to file in SUM 3015/2024, which was prepared pursuant to his further appeal in RAS 14/2024 (see <em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [14]-[19]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     The contested divorce hearing finally proceeded on 9 September 2024. It had been moved from an in-person to a remote hearing, in deference to the Husband’s alleged heart condition, so that he could be at liberty to call for or arrange medical assistance if needed. At the start of the hearing, the Husband protested against its commencement, revealing that he had <em>pre-ordered</em> an ambulance some four to five days before the hearing to take him away during the hearing. Nevertheless, as he was able to cogently advance his position with regard to his medical condition and answer the court’s questions, I allowed the Plaintiff to proceed with her examination-in-chief.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     At the hearing before me, the Wife affirmed the facts averred to in her Statement of Particulars, which I summarise as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 23 October 2019, the Husband accused the Wife of having an affair with her degree classmate RG. He lost his temper and kicked her in the stomach, held her by the neck and pushed her forcefully against a window without a grill, which made her fear for her life. A police report was made by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_b\"></a>(b)     In January 2020, under constant demand by the Husband for a paternity test on the allegation that the younger child was not his, the Wife finally agreed to a prenatal paternity test, which proved that the child did indeed belong to the Husband. She also alleged that he had prevented her from going on holiday to China, and had earlier told her friends and church members that the baby was not his, causing her humiliation, embarrassment and stress. When she learned that the Husband had pawned her jewellery and used the money to pay for the paternity test, she made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 30 April and 1 May 2020, she alleged that he asked for $100 from her, called her office and threatened to make her bedbound. She made a further police report as she was concerned about her children if something should happen to her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 6 July 2020, the Husband allegedly followed the Wife and her daughter to a coffeeshop near their residence, asking money for the car insurance, shouting loudly, scolding her while pointing his finger at her, and threatening that he would send messages or videos of her allegedly having an extramarital affair to her workplace Facebook page. This left her emotionally distressed as it was a crowded premise and she was heavily pregnant at the time. The following day, the Husband allegedly shouted at her again, leading the Wife to be distressed and in pain. She delivered her younger son later that day.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 2 January 2021, the Husband allegedly drove to the Wife’s friend’s home while she was there and created a disturbance. The Husband informed her other friends not to contact her anymore, or he would otherwise make trouble for them.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 4 February 2021, when the Wife kept silent in response to his request that she pay the monthly car loan, he allegedly held her neck and pushed her to the wall in the master bedroom, threatening her and accusing her of having a relationship with RG. Thereafter, the Wife was informed that the Husband had called her office to request to meet up with her boss, and had also called her close friends. His behaviour placed her in fear that he would harass her by airing their family issues with her friends and colleagues. Accordingly, the Wife applied for a PPO.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_g\"></a>(g)     In September 2021, the Wife saw the Husband having a meal with another lady, who told her that the Husband had treated her to the meal. The Wife was upset that he would treat another to a meal when he had not supported the family since 2018. She thereafter requested the car to be returned to her but this was refused, which led to her filing a further police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 29 November 2021, the Wife claimed that the Husband again accused her about the alleged affair with RG and threatened to report her for tax offences. He kicked the master bedroom door continuously and destroyed the CCTV in the master bedroom, which led to her calling the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 30 November 2021, the Wife claimed the Husband followed her around until she was forced to make a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 24 January 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband called the hospital in her daughter’s presence and asked where to make a report against the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_k\"></a>(k)     On 28 January 2022, the Husband allegedly pointed his finger at the Wife and made his usual allegations until she had to lock the master bedroom door to prevent him from entering.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_l\"></a>(l)     On 29 January 2022, he came back to the house, and followed her around the house, until she had to call the police.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_m\"></a>(m)     On 1 February 2022, the Wife alleged that the Husband tried to take her young son from her, and followed her around outdoors, where he again tried to take the son away from their helper. When the Wife stopped him, the Husband allegedly pushed her very hard over her shoulder. This led to her calling the police for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_n\"></a>(n)     On 2 February 2022, the Husband allegedly told the helper to leave the house and sat in the master bedroom, which made the Wife and daughter sleep in the helper’s bedroom. The police were called again for assistance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_o\"></a>(o)     On 3 February 2022, the Husband allegedly accused the Wife of having an affair again, grabbed her wrist forcefully, and only left when the helper made a police report.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_p\"></a>(p)     On 5 February 2022, the Wife agreed to meet the Husband’s two church friends to mediate. When she refused to withdraw her PPO application, he starting shouting and pointed his finger at her in front of the church friends, accusing her of stealing another person’s husband, and threatening to take the children away.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_q\"></a>(q)     On 7 February 2022, the Wife stated that her boss texted her, as her Husband had reported her to the hospital where she worked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_r\"></a>(r)     On 16 March 2022, the parties signed a Mutual Agreement, on the basis of which the Wife withdrew her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_s\"></a>(s)     On 25 March 2022, the Wife claimed the Husband again shouted at her and scolded her while pointing a finger at her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_t\"></a>(t)     On 26 March 2022, the Husband allegedly again accused the Wife of having an affair with RG, and threatened to report her to the authorities for tax offences which would result in her imprisonment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_u\"></a>(u)     On 28 March 2022, after consulting with her lawyer, the Wife alleged that the Husband followed her around, again accusing her of being a shameless woman and threatening to let others know what she had done on social media. While passing a coffee shop, he pulled her bag over her back harshly to get her to discuss with him at the coffee shop. He then followed her to the bus stop, while continually harassing her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_v\"></a>(v)     On 29 March 2022, the Husband again intercepted and harassed her at the bus stop in front of passers-by.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_w\"></a>(w)     On 28 June 2022, he came back to the matrimonial home, lost his temper, and again threatened to report the Wife to her workplace and IRAS, in front of her tenants and her children. She called the police thereafter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_16-p2_x\"></a>(x)     On 17 July 2022, the Wife claimed he came back to the matrimonial home with Covid-19, placing her and the children at risk, rather than submitting himself to quarantine under prevailing the prevailing rules of isolation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     The Wife had also tendered video and voice recordings (with accompanying transcripts) in relation to the incidents on the following dates:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     3 February 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     26 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     28 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_d\"></a>(d)     29 March 2022;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_e\"></a>(e)     28 June 2022; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_f\"></a>(f)     17 July 2022.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     In her supplementary affidavit, she further exhibited the Mutual Agreement which she claimed parties had entered into on 16 March 2022, which was signed by both parties and witnessed by Mr Foo. I note that handwritten amendments were made to clauses 6(c) and (d), to specify for joint custody, and also to make clear that the $50,000 compensation was contingent on there being no breach of clauses 1 and 3. The amendments were signed by all three parties.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     In summary, the Wife claimed that she was drained after four years of emotional torture from and physical aggression by the husband, with whom she had not lived together since October 2019. She also pointed out that he made no financial contribution to the household, while collecting rental from the two rooms which were tenanted out in the matrimonial home. He would also appear to make trouble in the house whenever he needed money, and his actions had resulted in the loss of her circle of friends and embarrassment before her colleagues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     At the conclusion of the Wife’s evidence-in-chief, the Husband refused to cross-examine her on account of his alleged poor health. After repeated requests for him to proceed, I took his continued refusal to mean that he had no questions in cross-examination and directed him to proceed with his evidence-in-chief. The Husband then proceeded to testify that he was “conned” into singing the Mutual Agreement. I informed him that it was no point disputing the Mutual Agreement at this stage as it was immaterial to the issue of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Whether the Mutual Agreement was valid and carried any weight would be germane to the ancillary proceedings. At this point, the ambulance that the Husband had pre-ordered arrived and the hearing was terminated prematurely.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     I would note at this point that the Husband had in his AEIC denied the alleged incidents on 23 October 2019, November 2019, 30 April 2019, 1 May 2020, 6 July 2020, 2 January 2021, 4 February 2021, August – September 2021, 29 November 2021, 30 November 2021, 24 January 2022, 29 January 2022, 1 February 2022 and 2 February 2022. He claimed that these were bare assertions, and as to any police reports made, no action was taken. He also submitted in his affidavit that incidents occurring more than six months before the filing of the Writ for divorce (dated 4 August 2022) should not be relied upon. I note that this position arises out of his erroneous reading of section 95(6) of the Women’s Charter 1961 (which is now rephrased as the new section 95A(3) that came into force after the filing of the writ). Section 95(6) states:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">Where the plaintiff alleges that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with him, but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the plaintiff and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of subsection 3(b) whether the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant if the length of that period or of those periods together was 6 months or less.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     The above provision has no relevance in the present case because parties had essentially ceased to live together since October 2019, and all the alleged incidents of unreasonable behaviour had taken place after that date. There is therefore no question of the Wife having acquiesced to the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour by continuing to reside with him for more than six months after the fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     In his AEIC, the Husband also provided his explanations for the series of incidents raised in the Wife’s Statement of Particulars. In summary, his explanations were as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_a\"></a>(a)     On 5 February 2022, during a mediation session held with his two church friends, he did not lose his temper, point or yell at the Plaintiff, and the mediation was intended to help restore their relationship.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_b\"></a>(b)     On 7 February 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff through her boss at the hospital where she worked, and explained that his intent was to seek the boss’ help to persuade her to withdraw her PPO application.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_c\"></a>(c)     On 16 March 2022, he claimed that he was unduly influenced by the Wife to sign the mutual agreement, did not receive independent legal advice, and did not understand is terms as he was English illiterate.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 25 March 2022, he denied pointing his fingers at the Wife in the master bedroom, or yelling or scolding her in front of their daughter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_e\"></a>(e)     On 26 March 2022, he explained that he had told the Wife that the settlement agreement only applied to the PPO application, and should have no effect on the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_f\"></a>(f)     On 28 March 2022, he explained that he had confronted the Wife to tell her it was not right of her to use Mr Foo as he had approached the said counsel first.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_g\"></a>(g)     On 29 March 2022, he denied telling the Wife she was evil, that she would go to prison, or that he had shouted at the Plaintiff. He claimed they just walked and talked.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_h\"></a>(h)     On 28 June 2022, he claimed he did not threaten to report the Wife to her employer or to IRAS for tax offences if she refused to give him monies to pay the car insurance premium. He also explained he had simply removed the CCTV camera as it was faulty and had not forcibly removed it.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_i\"></a>(i)     On 17 July 2022, he denied threatening the Plaintiff in relation to asking her for financial help for his car insurance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_23-p2_j\"></a>(j)     On 17 and 18 July 2022, he denied that he had returned to the flat with Covid-19, and claimed that he just had a normal flu bug.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 30 September 2024</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     After the first hearing date of 9 September 2024 was disrupted due to the planned arrival of paramedics, the Husband filed a recusal application (SUM 3015/2024) against me. On the resumption of the hearing on 30 September 2024, I heard and dismissed the recusal application. However, the Husband refused to proceed thereafter with the divorce proceedings, on account of his health condition. I therefore directed that parties exchange a list of questions to be asked of the other party via correspondence copied to the court by 7 October 2024, and that if no further questions were tendered, I would take it that there would be no questions to be raised in cross-examination. I further directed that each party file their final reply affidavits, to be limited to answers to the questions raised, by 18 October 2024. The hearing of the contested divorce was then adjourned to 22 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     In making these unusual directions, I note that under the Family Justice Rules 2014 (“FJR”), the court has the ultimate discretion to decide whether a party is to be orally cross-examined at trial. In particular, Rule 590(1) of the FJR specifies that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">590.—(1)    Without prejudice to the generality of rule 589, and unless otherwise provided by any written law or by these Rules, at the trial of an action commenced by writ —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    evidence-in-chief of a witness must be given by way of affidavit; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)     <b>unless the Court otherwise orders</b> or the parties to the action otherwise agree —</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(i)     <b>such a witness must attend trial for cross-examination</b>; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(ii)   in default of his attendance, his affidavit shall not be received in evidence except with the leave of the Court.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     Further, Rule 591 allows the Court to give evidence of any particular fact by a statement on oath:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">591.—(1)    Without prejudice to rule 590, the Court may, at or before the trial of any action, order that evidence of any particular fact shall be given at the trial in such manner specified by the order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(2)    In particular, the Court may order <b>that evidence of any particular fact may be given at the trial —</b></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)     <b>by statement on oath of information or belief</b>;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    by the production of documents or entries in books;</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    by copies of documents or entries in books; or</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(d)    in the case of a fact which is or was a matter of common knowledge either generally or in a particular place, by the production of a specified newspaper which contains a statement of that fact.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[<em>Emphasis added</em>]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     I considered that given the manner in which the Husband repeatedly replied on medical certificates in relation to his heart condition to brazenly delay or avoid court proceedings, the only way to move the matter forward was to convert oral cross-examination to the written process described, since the Husband was simply unwilling to cross-examine the Wife nor allow her to cross-examine him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     I would add that it was essential to take this case firmly in hand as by September 2024, more than two years had passed since the filing of the divorce writ. It would be an abuse of process to allow the Wife to be continually stymied by the Husband’s refusal to proceed with court testimony, in spite of every accommodation being made to allow him to participate remotely from a clinic or hospital if need be. I also note that allowing the Husband to write and respond to questions in his own time outside of trial would surely not tax his constitution. To date, he has not complained of any inability to file documents, and indeed has pursued appeals relentlessly during periods covered by his medical certificates. Nor would he suffer any prejudice by way of written exchange, since any issue which merited closer examination could have been followed up with a request for further questions and responses in writing. For these reasons, I was of the view that proceeding by way of written questions and answers would be the most expeditious and fair way to move forward given the Husband’s refusal to proceed with oral cross-examination in the contested divorce hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">Written Cross-Examination Questions and the Wife’s Reply</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     Both parties filed their cross-examination questions to the other on 7 October 2024. However, only the Wife replied with her reply affidavit dated 16 October 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_30\"></a>30     In the Wife’s reply, she made the following points:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The Mutual Agreement was initiated by the Husband to get her to withdraw the PPO application, and he had pressured her to enter into the proposal. The lawyer Mr Foo was appointed by her Husband, and she had no prior contact or discussion with Mr Foo prior to its signing. Neither had she paid for Mr Foo’s services. She also denied that the Mutual Agreement was intended as a warning, and that they would reconcile after its signing. She subsequently employed a lawyer from PKWA Law Practice to file for divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, she pointed out that Mr Foo was fluent in Mandarin and that the Husband had received independent legal advice from his counsel before entering into the Mutual Agreement.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_c\"></a>(c)     She denied that the discussion with two church members on 5 February 2024 was for the purposes of reconciliation, and that the Husband’s request was for her to withdraw the PPO application against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_d\"></a>(d)     On 14 February 2024, the Husband had sent her an email in relation to his report against her to the hospital at which she was employed. The email reads as follows:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">Thank you (XXX Hospital) for a thorough internal investigation… I have evidence on my side that some of the actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) have seriously damaged the reputation of (XXX Hospital). If these actions of Nurse Manager (Wife) were published on the electronic network of mass communication, if they were published in mass media, the nurse manager (Wife) is going to jail.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_30-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In 2024, the Husband had promised to send the car to the scrapyard by 12 January 2024 but failed to do so. He instead demanded that the Wife pay $5,274.69 that was owed by him to the car dealer. She had no choice but to make this payment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_31\"></a>31     To date, the Husband has failed to file a reply in response to the Wife’s cross-examination questions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_32\"></a>32     I would also point out that the Husband was not labouring under the misapprehension that his intervening appeal filed on 7 October 2024 against my dismissal of his recusal application operated as a stay of proceedings. I had reminded the Husband of this point at the hearing of 30 September 2024, and the Husband had actually filed a separate application for a stay pending appeal in SUM 3232/2024, which was dismissed by my brother District Judge Chia Wee Kiat on 23 October 2024. Nevertheless, in the interest of natural justice, the hearing of the contested divorce was adjourned to allow the Husband’s appeal regarding the recusal application to be heard. After two fixtures on 19 November 2024 and 11 December 2024 before the High Court were adjourned, again on account of the Husband’s heart condition, the appeal was heard and dismissed on 28 February 2025 by Choo Han Teck J.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The Contested Divorce Proceedings on 5 March 2025</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_33\"></a>33     At the reconvened hearing of the contested divorce on 5 March 2025, I considered that the Husband had had more than four months since the deadline of 18 October 2024 to file his reply affidavit. I could only take his failure to do so as a clear indication that he did not wish to respond to the Plaintiff’s questions in cross-examination. Indeed, from his conduct through the course of these proceedings, it did not seem that the Husband had any serious intent to contest these proceedings, apart from causing incontrovertible delay and inconvenience to the Wife. With regard to his explanation that his purported medical condition necessitated the delay, I repeat the observations made in my grounds of decision in the recusal application that the court has provided sufficient accommodation to his medical condition (<em>WPF v WPG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/32334-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 91</a>, at [28]):</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">In the present case, every reasonable accommodation has been made in view of the Defendant’s medical issues, including multiple adjournments and a shift in the modality of hearing, first to a remote hearing, and finally to an exchange of questions and answers by way of affidavit. There is no indication that the Defendant is unable to pen thoughts to paper to further his case, and these special directions have been given to move proceedings along in a manner that minimises any risk posed to the Defendant’s health.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_34\"></a>34     I further note that it had at this point been 2 ½ years since the writ had been filed on 4 August 2022, and an immense amount of latitude that had been granted to the Plaintiff at both the Family and the High Court on account of his alleged medical condition. This contested divorce hearing had itself been adjourned nine times over ten fixtures on 13 August 2024, 27 August 2024, 9 September 2024, 18 September 2024, 26 September 2024, 30 September 2024, 22 October 2024, 2 December 2024, 2 January 2025, and 5 March 2024. As mentioned, special arrangements had been made to ensure that proceedings could move forward while giving the Husband the option of arranging for medical assistance as needed during the hearing. Instead, the Husband had cynically taken advantage of this latitude by scheduling an emergency pickup by paramedics some four to five days in advance of the first hearing date of 9 September 2024. There can, to my mind, be no clearer indication of his intent to thwart and delay these contested divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_35\"></a>35     As I had observed in my written grounds for the recusal application, justice delayed would be justice denied. In family matters, this adage carries even greater weight as the welfare of parties and their children may be irrevocably prejudiced by lengthened proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_36\"></a>36     Indeed, as a general principle of litigation, once trial dates are fixed, the expeditious resolution of the matter before the court is paramount. It is not for a party to dictate timelines by its own default. This was recognised by the High Court in <em>Affert Resources Pte Ltd (in compulsory winding up) v Industries Chimiques du Senegal and another</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30495-SSP.xml')\">[2023] SGHC 305</a>, where the appellant had disregarded multiple court deadlines backed by an unless order to file its expert affidavit. In that case, Goh Yihan J dismissed the application for an extension of time to file the affidavit, which would have necessitated an adjournment of the trial, noting at [37] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">It is the respondents’ prerogative to want the matter to be determined as expeditiously as possible. Indeed, it is also the court’s prerogative for the expeditious determination of the matter in order to uphold the due administration of civil justice, where a party cannot hog a court’s time and resources for adjudication. Therefore, the appellant should not be allowed to dictate timelines by its own default.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_37\"></a>37     This sentiment finds expression in English authority as well, in the case of <em>Wallersteiner v Moir</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/English/12194-E-M.xml')\">[1974] 1 WLR 991</a>. The plaintiff in that matter (Dr Wallersteiner) had his claim dismissed for want of prosecution, and judgment was entered on a counterclaim against him, as he had delayed proceedings by failing to file his pleadings for 12 months. On appeal, Lord Denning MR upheld the decision, emphasising that intentional prolonging of proceedings undermined the course of justice and would bring the legal system into disrepute. The learned judge noted at page 1017 that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">The evidence shows that Dr. Wallersteiner has grossly abused the process of the courts. He has staved off the hour of judgment by one shift after another. He has fabricated documents in an attempt to deceive the courts. Even now he would seek more delay so as to put in a defence. If it were given to him, the case might go on for ever. It would so exhaust &quot;courage, finances, patience, hope&quot; that those who have lost their money would say of this court: “Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than go there.” I know there has been no trial of Dr, Wallersteiner. These proceedings are only interlocutory. But, even so, something must be done now. We must brook no further delay.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_38\"></a>38     In a similar vein, the present proceedings for an interim order for divorce should not be delayed any further. On the basis of the pleadings and affidavits filed, as well as oral evidence given at the earlier hearings, and the Wife’s reply affidavit to the Husband’s written cross-examination questions, I considered that there was ample evidence to proceed to decide the matter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">My Decision</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_39\"></a>39     At the close of the hearing on 5 March 2025, I found that there was incontrovertible evidence of harassment by the Husband of the Wife over the course of the marriage in the years leading up to the filing of the divorce on 4 August 2022. The Husband had clearly threatened the Wife in relation to reporting her for alleged tax offences. He had seen through his threats to air their grievances to her friends, colleagues and her boss, the latter of which was clearly evidenced in his email of 14 February 2024. His behaviour had resulted in an investigation that had taken place at her workplace, which would have caused the Wife considerable embarrassment and humiliation. Further, the Husband’s explanation that he had written to the Wife’s boss merely to seek his help to get her to withdraw the PPO is specious and flies in the face of reason. There is no justification whatsoever for raising their familial dispute in the workplace context, except to humiliate her and pressure her to bend to his will.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_40\"></a>40     I further observe that in the course of their disagreements, both at home and in public, the Husband’s tone had been consistently threatening and aggressive. This was evident in the various audio and video recordings tendered by the Wife. The numerous police reports made by the Wife also speak to the clear breakdown of their relationship in the years prior to the filing of her writ.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_41\"></a>41     Financially, the Husband had also not provided for the household for many years, and despite taking the rental proceeds for the rental of two spare rooms in the matrimonial home, he continually badgered the Wife for financial assistance, most notably in respect of payment of the car insurance and related expenses.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_42\"></a>42     The Husband had also left the matrimonial home since October 2019 and the parties had not had any meaningful relationship as husband and wife since that date. Quite to the contrary, it was abundantly apparent that the Wife lived in constant fear and trepidation of his harassing and controlling behaviour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_43\"></a>43     I also did not accord any credence to the Husband’s bare denials regarding the multiple incidents raised by the Wife in her pleadings. His refusal to subject himself to oral cross-examination or to provide answers to her written questions casts serious doubt on his credibility and motivation in contesting these proceedings. His intent is clearly not to preserve the marriage, but to inflict maximal pain and punishment against the Wife for her temerity to seek a divorce against him.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     Given the compelling and overwhelming evidence, I had no doubt that the marriage had irretrievably broken down on account of the Husband’s unreasonable behaviour. It was also evident that there was no possibility of reconciliation given the failed interventions by mutual friends and the pattern of hostility exhibited by the Husband over the years. I therefore granted interim judgment in the Wife’s favour. As she did not request for costs, I directed that there be no order as to costs in these contested divorce proceedings.</p> </div></content></root>"},{"tags":["Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property is considered to have been “acquired” before marriage if it was purchased and partially paid for before marriage while the balance of the purchase price was paid for during marriage via the property’s rental income – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Matrimonial assets – Division – Whether property which had been occupied for a total of about 16 months (in two periods) during an 8½ year marriage is considered to have been “ordinarily used ... by both parties ... while the parties are residing together for shelter” – Applicable considerations – Section 112(10)(a)(i) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Care and control – Child – Whether there should be an order of shared care and control on the facts","Family Law – Maintenance – Child – Child placed under shared care and control of his parents – Applicable considerations","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Applicable considerations – Difference with maintenance for wife – Sections 69(1) and 114(2) of the Women’s Charter 1961","Family Law – Maintenance – Former wife – Appropriate multiplier and multiplicand to compute maintenance for former wife in an 8½ year marriage who is gainfully employed and has one child"],"date":"2025-06-09","court":"Family Court","case-number":"Divorce No 1469 of 2023 (Ancillary Matters)","title":"XCR v XCS","citation":"[2025] SGFC 64","url":"https://www.lawnet.sg:443/lawnet/web/lawnet/free-resources?p_p_id=freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet&p_p_lifecycle=1&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_action=openContentPage&_freeresources_WAR_lawnet3baseportlet_docId=%2FJudgment%2F33368-SSP.xml","counsel":["Eugene Chan Qi Ming (M/s Harry Elias Partnership LLP) for the Husband","Malcus Poh June Zhe (M/s Malcus Poh Law Corporation) for the Wife."],"timestamp":"2025-06-12T16:00:00Z[GMT]","coram":"Kow Keng Siong","html":"<root><head><title>XCR v XCS</title></head><content><div class=\"contentsOfFile\"> <h2 align=\"center\" class=\"title\"><span class=\"caseTitle\"> XCR <em>v</em> XCS </span><br><span class=\"Citation offhyperlink\"><a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/33368-SSP.xml')\">[2025] SGFC 64</a></span></h2><table id=\"info-table\"><tbody><tr class=\"info-row\"><td class=\"txt-label\" style=\"padding: 4px 0px;

Suppose that <em>before</em> marrying “W”, “H” purchases a property and pays for it partially using his own funds. Suppose further that “H” then pays the balance of the purchase price <em>during</em> marriage by using (a) his parents’ funds and (b) the property’s rental income. Has “H” “acquired” the property before or during marriage? Is the property a matrimonial asset? These issues arose in the present case.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_2\"></a>2       These are the background facts. The Plaintiff (“<b>Husband</b>”) and Defendant (“<b>Wife</b>”) grew up in the People’s Republic of China and were married there in February 2015.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_1\" id=\"Ftn_1_1\"><sup>[note: 1]</sup></a></span> Later that same year, they came to Singapore because the Husband had found employment here.

It was purchased in 2011, i.e., about four years <em>before</em> the marriage (2015). The Husband had paid the bulk of its purchase price <em>before</em> the marriage. The balance of the purchase price was paid <em>during</em> marriage via (a) funds from his parents (between 2016 to 2017) and (b) rental income from the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_9\" id=\"Ftn_9_1\"><sup>[note: 9]</sup></a></span> It is not disputed that the Wife did not make any payment towards the property.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Wife’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       According to the Wife, the Beijing property is a “matrimonial asset” and she should thus be given a share of it.

They continued to reside there after the marriage, until the Plaintiff’s relocation to Singapore in May 2015.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Beijing property was jointly renovated and prepared specifically for marriage, with the Wife personally overseeing the renovation, choosing furniture, fittings and interior design, with clear evidence of intent to use the property as the first matrimonial home have been provided by the Wife.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Even after the parties moved to Singapore, the Wife continued to reside there for a period with her mother, and the parties returned to live in the Beijing home from May 2017 to August 2018 during the Husband’s employment in China.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties also hosted both sides of the extended family in the Beijing home for festive celebrations, including Chinese New Year and birthdays — affirming its role as the central family dwelling.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Even after relocating to Singapore, the parties resumed residence at the Beijing property when the Husband worked in China between May 2017 and August 2018. It is significant that they did not lease out the property prior to this period, a telling fact that shows the property was held back for personal use rather than treated as an income generating investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The family’s use of the property was consistent and deeply embedded. The couple celebrated multiple Chinese New Years, birthdays, and reunions in this home with both sides of their family. It was a site of joyful family gatherings and shared tradition, further cementing its emotional and symbolic status as the nucleus of the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The parties deliberately left the property vacant for the bulk of the marriage rather than leasing it out — a significant financial sacrifice that underscores the symbolic and practical role of the Beijing home as a family sanctuary, not an investment.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_7-p2_h\"></a>(h)     It is further not disputed that the parties have resided in the matrimonial home during the significant months leading to their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Husband’s case</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Husband submitted that the Beijing property is not a matrimonial asset.

Such works were carried out by the Husband with the assistance of a home designer and a foreman. As the parties were dating at the material time, the Wife would occasionally visit the renovation site and he would seek her inputs on the renovations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The Husband had allowed the Wife and her mother to stay in the Beijing property shortly after the marriage. This was because he did not want them to incur rental expenses for their short stay in Beijing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Contrary to the Wife’s evidence, the parties did not have the 2015 Chinese New Year reunion dinner at the Beijing property. This dinner took place before the marriage and was held at the property for convenience.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_d\"></a>(d)     When the Husband was working in China, the Wife had lived with him at the Beijing property for only about <em>nine months</em> – in June 2017 and from January to August 2018. Contrary to her evidence, she did not stay there in May and July to December 2017 as she was studying at NTU at the material time.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_e\"></a>(e)     Apart from the periods stated in (d) above, the Beijing property was either rented out by the Husband or used to house him, his relatives and/or his family members.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_f\"></a>(f)     The Husband was the sole party who dealt with the Beijing property. He did not need to account to the Wife for such dealings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_8-p2_g\"></a>(g)     The Wife did not make any mention about the Beijing property in her first ancillary matters affidavit. This showed that she did not regard the property as their matrimonial home.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Issues to be determined</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_9\"></a>9       The Wife’s case that the Beijing property is matrimonial asset is based on s 112(10)(a)(i) of the Charter. Accordingly, the issues are as follows. Was the Beijing property “acquired” by the Husband before the marriage? If the answer is yes, then was the property “ordinarily used by both parties ... while [they were] residing together for shelter”. If the answer to also yes, then the Beijing property is a matrimonial asset. I will now address these issues.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Was the Beijing property acquired before the marriage</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_10\"></a>10     At the outset, I note that the parties took the position that the Beijing property had been acquired before their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     I have difficulties accepting this position. Let me explain.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_a\"></a>(a)     According to s 112(10)(b) of the Charter, matrimonial assets include “any other asset of any nature <em>acquired during the marriage</em> by one party or both parties to the marriage”. (emphasis added)</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring <em>not merely to the point of purchase</em> of an asset, but to the entire course of its acquisition. See, for instance, <em>BHN v BHO</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0091.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 91</a> (“<b><em>BHN</em></b>”) at [36] where the court accepted the following observations in <em>Chee Kok Choon v Sern Kuang Eng</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/MLJ/48907-M.xml')\">[2005] 4 MLJ 461</a> (“<b><em>Chee Kok Choon</em></b>”):</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">9    ... The word ‘acquired’ is not the same as ‘purchased’ as ordinarily understood. In a family law setting, especially in terms of division of matrimonial assets, a down-payment may have been paid, and one party may continue mortgage instalments for the next 15 or 20 years. <em>In such a case, the ‘acquisition’ continues until the asset is fully acquired.</em> ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c\"></a>(c)     Courts have applied the above interpretation of “acquired” to cases where the property was purchased by the owning spouse <em>before</em> marriage and the mortgage instalments were paid using the owning spouse’s <em>CPF funds during</em> marriage. Here are some examples.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>BHN</em> –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">39    ... <b>even if</b> Lagoon View was <b>purchased before</b> the marriage, the plaintiff continued to service the housing loan through her CPF contributions <em>during</em> the marriage, until 1998 when the property became fully paid up. If the plaintiff had not been paying for the housing loan, any CPF contributions earned by her during the marriage <b>would have remained in her CPF account and would have to be included in the pool of matrimonial assets</b> for the purpose of the determination of ancillary matters. As such, at least a portion of Lagoon View should be viewed as having been “acquired during the marriage” and a matrimonial asset. Simply put, the fact that the defendant made no financial contribution to Lagoon View is irrelevant as matrimonial assets rightly include assets acquired by <em>either</em> spouse’s personal efforts during the marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-4\"><a id=\"\"></a>[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>BGT v BGU</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/[2013] SGHC 0050.xml')\">[2013] SGHC 50</a> (“<b><em>BGT</em></b>”) –</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-3\">29    ... it is well established that any contributions to [the husband’s] account from moneys earned <em>after</em> the marriage would form part of the matrimonial assets. If the husband had not been paying for the Tanamera property, his monthly contributions during the marriage would have remained in his CPF account and there would have been no doubt at the end of the marriage that those contributions would have to be included as part of the matrimonial assets. ...</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_d\"></a>(d)     In our case, the Husband did not, during marriage, use his CPF funds to pay the mortgage loan for the Beijing property. Instead, the loan was paid with (i) funds from his parents and (ii) <em>rental income</em> from the property. Does the source of funds used to pay the mortgage loan affect the identity of the person “acquiring” the property?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_e\"></a>(e)     In <em>THL v THM</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18154-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 11</a> (“<b><em>THL</em></b>”), the court answered the above question in the negative.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">41    ... The question which next arises is whether, on the Father’s argument, the London Properties should nevertheless be taken <em>out</em> of the scope of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>) because, as he says, <b>the funds used for repaying the mortgage loans come primarily from the rental income generated on those properties</b> and, to a lesser extent, his pre-matrimonial income. In other words, <em>BHN</em> only applied where the acquisition is serviced by “active earnings”; in <em>BHN</em> the acquisition was paid with salary earned. The unarticulated premise of this argument is that notwithstanding that an asset appears to have been acquired during the course of a particular marriage, the court should go on to scrutinise the <em>source of funds</em> for the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">42    In my judgment, this does not accord with the wording of s 112(10)(<em>b</em>), which <b>simply directs the court’s inquiry to the </b><b><em>timing of the acquisition</em></b> <b>of the property concerned</b>. ... Whether he funds a specific investment within this portfolio out of his salary or a pre-existing pool of money is arbitrary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis in italics is in original text; emphasis in bold is added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f\"></a>(f)     To sum-up –</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_i\"></a>(i)       Courts have interpreted the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) as referring not merely to the point of purchase of a property, but to the entire course of its acquisition. A property is “acquired” only when it has been fully paid for.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_f-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       If the owning spouse continues to pay for the property during marriage for the purpose of acquiring it, then it is a matrimonial asset pursuant to s 112(10)(b). This is so regardless of the source of the spouse’s payments.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g\"></a>(g)     This leads to the next issue. Should the above interpretation of “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) similarly apply to the same word in s 112(10)(a)(i)? In my view, the answer should be yes.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_i\"></a>(i)        <em>First</em>, it is settled law that a piece of statute should be construed as a whole and purposively. It is well accepted that “the Parliamentary draftsman would not indulge in elegant variation, but would keep to a particular term when wishing to convey a particular meaning”. In line with this, a word or a phrase has the same meaning throughout the statute unless the contrary intention is shown. See e.g., <em>Chng Gim Huat v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 2 SLR(R) 0360.xml')\">[2000] 2 SLR(R) 360</a> at [101]; <em>Fernandez Joseph Ferdinent v Public Prosecutor</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2007] 3 SLR(R) 0065.xml')\">[2007] 3 SLR(R) 65</a> at [24]; <em>Woon Brothers Investments Pte Ltd v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No. 461</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/13184-SSP-M.xml')\">[2011] 4 SLR 777</a> at [19]. In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that Parliament had intended the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i) and s 112(10)(b) is to have different meanings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_11-p2_g-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)        <em>Second</em>, to interpret the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(b) and s 112(10)(a)(i) differently will mean that the <em>same</em> property in the scenarios in [11(c)] and [11(e)] above is simultaneously (1) a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(b)) and (2) not a matrimonial asset (when construed under s 112(10)(a)(i)). This is absurd.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_12\"></a>12     I am mindful that there is <em>dictum</em> in <em>USB v USA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24962-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 2 SLR 588</a> (“<b><em>USB</em></b>”) that <em>may suggest</em> that a property can be treated as having been “acquired” even though it has not been fully paid for. For ease of reference, I reproduced substantively [19] of <em>USB</em>. Note in particular [19(c)] –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">19    ... Section 112 of the Charter contemplates that assets in at least three categories may be subject to the court’s powers of division. The classes of assets that the parties may possess are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(a)    “Quintessential matrimonial assets” ...: these are assets which either spouse derived from income earned during the marriage or to which either spouse or both spouses obtained legal title during the marriage by applying their own money, and the matrimonial home, whenever and however acquired. The <em>entire value</em> of these assets assessed as at the ancillary matters date (generally) will go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(b)    “Transformed matrimonial assets”: we use this term to denote assets which were acquired before the marriage by one spouse (or, more rarely, by both spouses), but ... which were ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or their children while residing together for purposes such as shelter, transport, household use, <em>etc</em>. Once transformed, the <em>whole asset</em> goes into the pool but <em>if there is no transformation then, subject to (c)</em> below, any asset acquired before the marriage even if acquired by both parties would be dealt with in accordance with <em>general principles of property law.</em></p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(c)    “Pre-marriage assets”: these are assets that either spouse <b><em>acquired </em></b><em>before</em> the marriage and ... which are not used for family purposes. These stay out of the pool unless ... they are <b><em>partially paid for </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage by the owning spouse with income that would have been a quintessential matrimonial asset had it been saved up rather than expended on the pre-marriage asset. Then, the proportion of the value of the asset that was<b><em> acquired </em></b><em>during</em> the marriage should go into the pool.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_13\"></a>13     In my view, <em>USB</em> do not preclude the view taken in [11(g)] above. <em>First</em>, the court there did not seek to lay down a definition for the word “acquired” in s 112(10)(a)(i). <em>Second</em>, there is nothing in its judgement to show that the court had been alerted to the caselaw and considerations in [11] above on the interpretation of the word “acquired”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Thus, in line with well settled caselaw, since the purchase price of the Beijing property was paid by the Husband (via funds from his parents and the property’s rental income) <em>during</em> the marriage, the property is a “matrimonial asset” pursuant to <em>s 112(10)(b)</em>.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">Did the parties “ordinarily use” the Beijing property together for shelter</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     Given the above, there is no need for me to further determine whether the Beijing property qualifies as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     However, since the parties had made substantial submissions on this issue, I will make some observations regarding this.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     I begin by setting out the applicable principles. To qualify as a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i), a property must satisfy three requirements.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_a\"></a>(a)     “<u>Residing together</u>”. <em>First</em>, both parties must have resided “together” at the property. Section 112(10)(a)(i) is not met if only one of them had resided there: <em>UZK v UZL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24585-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 1248</a> at [35]; <em>WAH v WAG</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/30974-SSP.xml')\">[2024] SGFC 6</a> at [66].</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_b\"></a>(b)     “<u>For shelter</u>”. <em>Second</em>, the property must have been used “for shelter”. Unlike s 112(10)(a)(ii) (which provides for the transformation of solely owned assets into matrimonial assets by way of “substantial improvement”), it is <em>not</em> necessary under s 112(10)(a)(i) for the property to have been used for shelter “during the marriage”. In other words, a property may be transformed into a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) even if the parties’ residence at the property had occurred <em>before</em> their marriage.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c\"></a>(c)     “<u>Ordinarily used</u>”. <em>Finally</em>, the parties’ residence at the property must be of “sufficient regularity and frequency”: <em>USB</em> at [24]; <em>CLB v CLC</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27504-SSP.xml')\">[2022] 1 SLR 658</a> at [26]; <em>TNC v TND</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/19114-SSP.xml')\">[2016] 3 SLR 1172</a> at [18]; <em>BJS v BJT</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2013] 4 SLR 0041.xml')\">[2013] 4 SLR 41</a> (“<b><em>BJS</em></b>”) at [23] and [24].

Put in another way, the purpose of this requirement is to prevent a party from acquiring a pre-marriage property by simply staying there “casually” or “occasionally” without contributing to the “marital partnership”: <em>Wan Lai Cheng v Quek Seow Kee</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2012] 4 SLR 0405.xml')\">[2012] 4 SLR 405</a> at [43]; <em>WQP v WQQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/32591-SSP.xml')\">[2024] 2 SLR 557</a> at [38].</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_ii\"></a>(ii)       In line with this, courts have held that a property is not a matrimonial asset under s 112(10)(a)(i) in the following cases: (1) it was occupied only occasionally during a two-year marriage (<em>BJS</em> at [23] and [24]), (2) it was a holiday home that was occupied for only 21 days in a 14-year marriage (<em>Ryan Neil John v Berger Rosaline</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2000] 3 SLR(R) 0647.xml')\">[2000] 3 SLR(R) 647</a> at [59] and [60]), and (3) it was occupied on only two occasions during a 10-year marriage (<em>JAF v JAE</em> [2016] 3 SLR(R) 717 at [15]).</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"p1_17-p2_c-p3_iii\"></a>(iii)       At this juncture, it bears noting that while the length of stay at the property is relevant in determining whether it is a matrimonial asset – this is not a decisive factor.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_14\" id=\"Ftn_14_1\"><sup>[note: 14]</sup></a></span> What is more important is whether the property had been used as a <em>matrimonial home</em> – or, to put it more elegantly, as the “cradle of the family”: <em>Chen Siew Hwee v Low Kee Guan</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2006] 4 SLR(R) 0605.xml')\">[2006] 4 SLR(R) 605</a> at [33].

According to him, when the son was an infant, he would take turns with the Wife to wake up at night to attend to the child and with the bottle feeding. It is also the Husband’s evidence that he had, among others, (i) coordinated the son’s weekly sessions with a speech therapist from September 2021 to February 2023, (ii) got the child ready in the morning and sent him to the childcare centre, (iii) picked up the son from the half-day childcare, (iv) enrolled him in full-day preschool, and (v) brought the child to the early intervention centre for four days a week since March 2024.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_77\" id=\"Ftn_77_1\"><sup>[note: 77]</sup></a></span> The foregoing evidence shows that the Husband is a hands-on father.

According to him, (i) he is able to work from home and be on flexi-hours, (ii) he will continue his arrangement of spending entire mornings with the son and bringing him for therapy sessions, (iii) he plans to buy an apartment close to the Wife’s future home to readily reach out and support the son when needed, (iv) he will enlist the help of his parents (who have a strong bond with the son) to help care for the son, and (v) he intends to hire the existing domestic helper (who is familiar with the son’s routines) to help with the household chores so that he can be freed up to care for the child. I find the Husband’s care plan to be “sound” and “practical”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_79\" id=\"Ftn_79_1\"><sup>[note: 79]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) The Wife had failed to convince me that the above evidence should be rejected.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_80\" id=\"Ftn_80_1\"><sup>[note: 80]</sup></a></span></p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(4)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Whether the parents can cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>Parties’ positions</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) The Husband believes that he and his Wife can co-parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_81\" id=\"Ftn_81_1\"><sup>[note: 81]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(b) The Wife is less optimistic. According to her, there is significant acrimony between the parties. Furthermore, the Husband had allegedly kept her out of important matters relating to the son. Specifically, he had (i) concealed from her information regarding the son’s diagnosis and recommended treatment, (ii) unilaterally made decisions on the child’s education and intervention methods without consulting her, (iii) failed to inform about the child’s field trips and a parent-teacher’s meeting, and (iv) failed to give her access to the son’s school communication app account until after she requested for it.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_82\" id=\"Ftn_82_1\"><sup>[note: 82]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>My decision</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(c) I am not persuaded by the Wife’s reasons as to why the parties cannot cooperate within an arrangement of shared care and control. These are my reasons.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(i) <em>First</em>, the matters raised by the Wife do not prove that co-parenting is not possible. Specifically, these matters do not show that the parties clearly cannot (1) discuss and agree on the son’s daily activities and (2) ensure that his daily life is seamless even when he switches homes: <em>XLS</em> at [9(d)]. </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) <em>Second</em>, the mere fact that there is acrimony in the parties’ relationship does not preclude a shared care and control arrangement: <em>XLS</em> at [9(e)]. In my view, the Wife can co-parent. I note the following evidence from her:<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_83\" id=\"Ftn_83_1\"><sup>[note: 83]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Although my marriage with the [Husband] is coming to an end, my only wish is to create a nurturing and secure environment for [the son] to grow up in. [The son] requires more love and support from his parents than other children, and I hope that, as his parents, we can both share this responsibility and work together to provide the support he needs for his life and development.

I accept the Husband’s submissions that the claims were raised only in the Wife’s last affidavit in February 2025<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_84\" id=\"Ftn_84_1\"><sup>[note: 84]</sup></a></span> and that he did not have the opportunity to respond to any of them.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_85\" id=\"Ftn_85_1\"><sup>[note: 85]</sup></a></span> Given that the Husband had sought a shared care and control arrangement as far back as in his first affidavit (March 2024), the Wife could (and should) have raised her claims earlier as to why the Husband cannot be trusted to co-parent.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_86\" id=\"Ftn_86_1\"><sup>[note: 86]</sup></a></span></p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(ii) For completeness, I wish to add that the law expects parents to cooperate to promote the child’s best interests. The <em>Husband is to note</em> that should he fail to involve the Wife in matters relating to the son, then this can affect, e.g., a court’s assessment as to whether such an order should be varied to a sole care and control order in favour of the Wife.</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(e) <em>Finally</em>, I note the parties have been attending counselling to assist them in co-parenting.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_87\" id=\"Ftn_87_1\"><sup>[note: 87]</sup></a></span> This can help to reduce the acrimony between them. Counselling can also remind them that the son needs them to be able to work together in his best interests.</p> </td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(5)</p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"br\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">Has there has been attempt to alienate the son?</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <em>Finding – Yes</em> </p> </td><td align=\"left\" class=\"b\" rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"top\"> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\"> <u>Parties’ position</u> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">(a) The Husband submitted that<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_88\" id=\"Ftn_88_1\"><sup>[note: 88]</sup></a></span> –</p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Table-Para-1\">... there are real concerns that the Wife will not be facilitative of the Husband’s access in the event where she has sole care and control. The Wife has a history of gatekeeping the child and preventing the Husband from spending time with the child.

s 114(2)(f) of the Charter.</p> <p class=\"Judg-3\"><a id=\"\"></a>(iii)       The Wife had suffered economic prejudice as a result of her sacrifices for the family. To support the Husband’s career, she had given up her own career in China to follow him to Singapore. The Husband accepted that despite having a master’s degree from China, the Wife had found it difficult to get a job here based on her qualifications. The situation became so untenable that she had to undertake a course lasting for a few months to improve her job prospects in Singapore.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_117\" id=\"Ftn_117_1\"><sup>[note: 117]</sup></a></span> Further, the Wife had to relocate from Singapore to China, and then back to Singapore again, so that the Husband could seek better career opportunities. During the marriage, the Wife had also stopped work for about 18 months to care for the son. Such a lengthy period of unemployment would surely have an impact on her career. To be clear, in deciding to order spousal maintenance for the Wife, I am mindful that such maintenance is not intended to compensate her for loss of employment or for income that she might have had the opportunity to earn: <em>VJM v VJL</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/27088-SSP.xml')\">[2021] 5 SLR 1233</a> at [43] and [44].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplicand</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_67\"></a>67     Having determined that it is appropriate to order spousal maintenance, the next issue is <em>how much</em> should be the amount in the present case. On this issue, s 114(2) of the Charter directs that if a court decides to order maintenance under s 113(1), then –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">... the court is to endeavour to <em>place the parties</em>, so far as it is practicable and, having regard to their conduct, just to do so, <em>in the financial position in which they would have been if the marriage had not broken down</em> and each had properly discharged his or her financial obligations and responsibilities towards the other.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">[emphasis added]</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_68\"></a>68     The overarching principle embodied in s 114(2) is that of financial preservation: <em>ATE v ATD</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/18402-SSP.xml')\">[2016] SGCA 2</a> at [31]. In my view, one way of achieving the objective in s 114(2) is to consider (a) what additional expenses a former wife would have to bear on her own, and (b) what income she would lose, as a direct result of the divorce. After considering these matters, a court will be in a better position to determine the amount of financial relief needed to help a former wife weather the transitions brought about by the divorce.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_69\"></a>69     It bears highlighting that when determining the quantum of the maintenance to order, a court is not required to ensure that a former wife is put in the same financial position as she was pre-divorce. Instead, a court is simply required to “endeavour” to minimise the financial disruption to her in “so far as it is practicable”. In this regard, s 114(1) stipulates that –</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\"> <b>114.</b>—(1) In determining the amount of any maintenance to be paid by a man to his wife or former wife, or by a woman to her incapacitated husband or incapacitated former husband, the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the following matters:</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>a</em>) the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>b</em>) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>c</em>) the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>d</em>) the age of each party to the marriage and the duration of the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>e</em>) any physical or mental disability of either of the parties to the marriage;</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>f</em>) the contributions made by each of the parties to the marriage to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-2\">(<em>g</em>) in the case of proceedings for divorce or nullity of marriage, the value to either of the parties to the marriage of any benefit (for example, a pension) which, by reason of the dissolution or annulment of the marriage that party will lose the chance of acquiring.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_70\"></a>70     Applying these principles to the present case, I make the following findings:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The maintenance sought by the Wife is unreasonable. <em>First</em>, she had failed to prove that if the marriage had not broken down, the Husband would have ordinarily paid for her expenses at $7,580/month. <em>Second</em>, I find that a number of the expenses that she had claimed for – e.g., transport (at $1,000/month), clothing (at $200/month), accessories (at $300/month), and holiday (at $1,000/month) – is excessive.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_118\" id=\"Ftn_118_1\"><sup>[note: 118]</sup></a></span><em>Finally</em>, I fail to understand why she is unable to pay for her personal expenses given that her income is $3,009/month: s 114(1)(a).</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_70-p2_b\"></a>(b)     With the divorce, the Wife will have to incur rental expenses: s 114(1)(b). She would not need to bear such expenses “if the marriage had not broken down”. Accordingly, I find it appropriate for the Husband to pay the Wife <b>$2,500/month</b> as financial relief to help cover her likely monthly deficits.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_119\" id=\"Ftn_119_1\"><sup>[note: 119]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-3\">The multiplier</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_71\"></a>71     The next question is for <em>how long</em> the maintenance should last.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_72\"></a>72     The Husband had submitted that the maintenance be limited to only six months. I am unable to accept the Husband’s submission.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_a\"></a>(a)     The period of maintenance proposed by the Husband is sufficient to cover the Wife’s rental expenses for only half a year. Her income is unlikely to increase by $2,500 in that time. After this period, is she supposed to dip into her share of the matrimonial assets to cover the deficits?</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_72-p2_b\"></a>(b)     Further, a short multiplier (such as six months) is generally ordered where there is a need to tide a former wife over for a short period to meet her immediate financial needs. One example is <em>UYD</em>. In that case, the High Court had ordered the man to pay his former wife six months’ maintenance to tide her over until he transferred $384,006.27 (of matrimonial funds) to her. Pursuant to the divorce, she had received four properties worth more than $15M. One of them was for her residence, and she could receive rental income from the other three properties as a substitute for maintenance: <em>UYD</em> at [65] to [67].</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_73\"></a>73     In my view, the period of maintenance should give the Wife sufficient time to adapt to her new circumstances post-divorce and to stabilise her finances. In this regard, applying s 114(1), I note the following.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_a\"></a>(a)      <em>First</em>, the Wife has a take-home income of about $3,009/month.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_b\"></a>(b)      <em>Second</em>, she has the capacity to earn more income because she (i) is relatively young (about 38 years old),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_120\" id=\"Ftn_120_1\"><sup>[note: 120]</sup></a></span> and (ii) has a master’s degree in sports science and a Master of Arts’ degree in teaching Chinese as an international language.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_73-p2_c\"></a>(c)      <em>Third</em>, the marriage is about 8½ years. The duration of the marriage is important to ensure that the period of maintenance is not excessive. See e.g., <em>ACY v ACZ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/[2014] 2 SLR 1320.xml')\">[2014] 2 SLR 1320</a> at [55] where the High Court rejected a prayer for a multiplier of three years of maintenance as being excessive when the marriage had lasted for only three years.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_74\"></a>74     Considering the factors wholistically, I find that a multiplier of <b>four years</b> of maintenance is reasonable. Such a multiplier is consistent with the following precedents:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\" pgwide=\"1\"><colgroup><col

and</p> <p class=\"Judg-QuoteList-2\">(e)    to pay the Defendant 37.31% of the sale proceeds (after deducting the sums mentioned in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c)), from which the Defendant will make the requisite refunds to his CPF accounts in accordance with the applicable CPF legislation.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(7)    The Plaintiff is to be paid $0.68 from the balance of $1.08 in [the OCBC Savings Account held by the parties as a joint account].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(8)    The Defendant is to be paid $0.40 from the balance of $1.08 in [the OCBC Savings Account held by the parties as a joint account].</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(9)    Each party is to retain all other assets in the sole name of that party.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(10)  The Defendant is to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Plaintiff, in satisfaction of the Plaintiff’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(11)  Costs of adjournment (on 18 December 2024) are fixed at $100 and to be borne by the Defendant’s counsel.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Quote-1\">(12)  Costs of the ancillary matters are fixed at $1,500 all in and to be paid by the Defendant to the Plaintiff.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_3\"></a>3       On 15 March 2025, the Husband filed a Notice of Appeal against the whole of my decision, after obtaining from an Assistant Registrar an extension of time to file the Notice of Appeal.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Evidence</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_4\"></a>4       Each party filed 2 affidavits of assets and means for the ancillary matters hearing. These are (in the sequence in which the affidavits were filed):</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_a\"></a>(a)     the Husband’s first affidavit of assets and means filed on 8 December 2023 (“DA1”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s first affidavit of assets and means filed on 8 December 2023 (“PA1”);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_c\"></a>(c)     the Husband’s second affidavit of assets and means filed on 13 March 2024 (“DA2”); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_4-p2_d\"></a>(d)     the Wife’s second affidavit of assets and means filed on 8 April 2024 (“PA2”).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_5\"></a>5       PA2 contained the Wife’s responses to the Husband’s statements in DA1. When the Husband filed DA2, he did not respond to many of the Wife’s statements in PA1. Instead, DA2 largely reproduced, with some modifications, the Husband’s statements in DA1, and exhibited additional supporting documents.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_6\"></a>6       Three other affidavits are mentioned in these Grounds of Decision. These were affidavits filed in relation to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories in FC/SUM 1770/2024 and FC/SUM 1771/2024, respectively. On 13 September 2024, an Assistant Registrar ordered the Husband to make certain clarifications, on affidavit, in relation to 2 withdrawals (of $5,000 and $25,000 made on 1 and 3 June 2023, respectively) from the Husband’s bank account, and to provide documents in support of these transactions or, if the Husband was unable to do so, to provide an explanation on affidavit and disclose any documents in support of the explanation. The 3 affidavits are:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_a\"></a>(a)     an affidavit filed by the parties’ son on 12 July 2024 (“SA1”) ostensibly in response to the Wife’s applications;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_b\"></a>(b)     an affidavit filed by the Husband on 12 July 2024 (“DA3”) in response to the Wife’s applications; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_6-p2_c\"></a>(c)     a compliance affidavit filed by the Husband on 9 October 2024 (“DA4”) in response to the orders made on 13 September 2024.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Facts</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-2\">The parties </p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_7\"></a>7       The parties were married in 1992. They have a son born in 1996. When the writ for divorce was filed on 5 May 2023, the Wife was about 62 years old, and the Husband was about 66 years old.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_8\"></a>8       The Wife’s last job was as a coffee shop assistant earning an average gross monthly income of around $1,400.

Both parties estimated the resale price of the Matrimonial Home to be about $455,000, based on the resale flat prices of similar HDB flats in Bedok with resale registration dates in May and September 2023.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_3\" id=\"Ftn_3_1\"><sup>[note: 3]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_11\"></a>11     The other Joint Asset is the balance in an OCBC

for distribution, I bore in mind the guidance given by the Family Division of the High Court in <em>UYP v UYQ</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/23358-SSP.xml')\">[2019] SGHCF 16</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/24412-SSP.xml')\">[2020] 3 SLR 683</a> at [4] that:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_a\"></a>(a)     generally, the operative date for the identification of the matrimonial assets is the date of the Interim Judgment;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_b\"></a>(b)     generally, matrimonial assets should be valued at the date of the ancillary matters hearing;</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_c\"></a>(c)     balances in bank accounts and Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) accounts are to be taken at the date of the Interim Judgment; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_13-p2_d\"></a>(d)     where the parties have specifically agreed to use (as the value for an asset) a value as at a different date, the Court may adopt that value.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">The parties’ cases</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_14\"></a>14     Under the Interim Judgment, the following ancillary matters were adjourned to be heard in Chambers:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_a\"></a>(a)     division of matrimonial assets (including the Matrimonial Home);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_b\"></a>(b)     the Wife’s claim for maintenance; and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_14-p2_c\"></a>(c)     costs of the divorce proceedings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_15\"></a>15     As regards the division of matrimonial assets, the parties agreed that the structured approach in <em>ANJ v ANK</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17620-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGCA 34</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/17925-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 4 SLR 1043</a> should apply. The parties also agreed that the parties’ direct financial contributions ratio should be 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour. However, there was no agreement on the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions. The Wife argues that the indirect contributions ratio should be 70 : 30 in the Wife’s favour. The Husband asks the Court to consider a 50 : 50 ratio for the parties’ indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_16\"></a>16     The Wife also submitted that there should be a further uplift of at least 3% of the average ratio in her favour. After the Wife commenced the divorce on 5 May 2023, the Husband withdrew a sum of $5,000 on 1 June 2023, and a further sum of $25,000 on 3 June 2023, from his OCBC bank account. The Husband claimed, in DA4, that the withdrawals were made “completely for [the parties’] son”, to “help [the parties’] son defray his expenses towards his tuition fees and the initial payment of his BTO (Built to order) flat”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_10\" id=\"Ftn_10_1\"><sup>[note: 10]</sup></a></span> The Husband also exhibited certain documents in DA4 in support of this claim. The Wife submitted that those documents did not show that the combined sum of $30,000 was transferred to the parties’ son or used as payment for the son’s tuition fees or HDB flat, and that therefore an adverse inference should be drawn against the Husband, and there should be an uplift in the Wife’s favour of at least 3% of the average ratio of the Wife’s direct and indirect contributions.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_17\"></a>17     As regards the Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife sought maintenance of $800 per month for 3 years. The Husband submitted that there should be no maintenance for the Wife. However, the Husband listed in DA1 and DA2, among his direct financial contributions towards the Matrimonial Home, a monthly payment of $300 described as “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_11\" id=\"Ftn_11_1\"><sup>[note: 11]</sup></a></span> The Husband also reiterated, at paragraph 26 of DA1, that he was “currently repaying” a “Loan of S$20,000.00 taken up by the Plaintiff”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Division of the matrimonial assets</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_18\"></a>18     I deal first with the division of the matrimonial assets.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_19\"></a>19     The Wife explained in considerable detail at paragraph 15 of PA1 why she was the main caregiver of the son, and why she should be regarded as having made the larger proportion of the indirect financial and non-financial contributions towards the matrimonial assets. The matters set out in paragraph 15 of PA1 that are relevant to the Wife’s indirect financial and non-financial contributions include the following:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_a\"></a>(a)     In 1989, the Wife set up a printing business called APG using her savings. In order to take over the premises to be occupied by APG, the Wife paid the landlord around $20,000 of outstanding rent owed by the previous tenant. The Wife purchased machinery and equipment, including 4 cameras that cost more than $30,000 each. The Wife also paid for renovations costing around $15,000. The Wife estimated that she spent over $100,000 to set up APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_b\"></a>(b)     The parties registered their marriage on 3 March 1992. The Wife paid for the parties’ first matrimonial property on her own, using her CPF moneys and cash. The Wife also paid for the renovations to, and furniture for, the matrimonial property. The Wife made all of those payments, as the Husband was then unemployed.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_c\"></a>(c)     The Husband was assisting the Wife with the running of APG by the time the Wife became pregnant in 1995. However, the Wife still had to go to work during her pregnancy, because the Husband was not familiar with the running of APG.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_d\"></a>(d)     The parties’ son was delivered by caesarean section, had jaundice after he was born, and had to be hospitalised for over 10 days. The Wife also had to return to the hospital after she was discharged, when the “wound split”. The Wife paid for the hospitalisation fees of over $20,000 using cash and her CPF moneys.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_e\"></a>(e)     The Wife continued to cook and do household chores after giving birth to the parties’ son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_f\"></a>(f)     After the parties’ son was discharged from the hospital, the Wife brought the son out for “suntan” every morning. The Wife also brought the son for check-ups at the polyclinic for 18 months.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_g\"></a>(g)     As the Husband was unfamiliar with aspects of APG’s business, the Wife would return to the office with the parties’ son to finish the work. While running APG’s business, the Wife topped up $30,000 into the Husband’s “Medishield account” (sic) for him.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_12\" id=\"Ftn_12_1\"><sup>[note: 12]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_h\"></a>(h)     In 1997, the Husband refused to let the Wife go back to running APG full-time, even though the Wife wanted to do so. The Wife therefore found a job, and engaged a domestic helper to look after the parties’ son while the Wife was at work. The Wife paid for the domestic helper’s salary and related expenses on her own, without help from the Husband. The Wife also took care of the parties’ son, and cooked dinner, after returning home from work.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_i\"></a>(i)     In 1998, whenever the parties’ son fell sick while attending daycare, the Wife attended to the son.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_j\"></a>(j)     In 1999, when the son was in kindergarten, the Wife would send the son to school and pick up the son from school.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_k\"></a>(k)     The Husband left everything concerning the education of the parties’ son to the Wife. The Wife visited several schools before enrolling the son in a kindergarten that the Wife thought would provide a better environment for the son. The Wife also enrolled the son in an English course that cost around $1,600, which the Wife paid for using her salary.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_l\"></a>(l)     When the parties’ son started primary school in 2003, the Wife would wake him up, get him ready for school, and wait with him for the school bus. The Wife also took leave to accompany the son on the first 3 days of school. When the son attended primary school in the afternoon, the Wife would go to work later, and pick up the son after work. The Wife cooked the family’s meals when she did not have to work on Sundays. The Wife helped the son with his homework until he was in Primary 4, when she could no longer help him. The Wife attended all the meet-the-parents sessions of the son’s school on her own.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_m\"></a>(m)     Until 2007, the Wife continued to go back to APG after work to complete tasks that the Husband did not know how to do. When the parties’ son was young, the Wife would bring him along, and watch over him while she finished tasks. Throughout the years from 1989 to 2007, the Wife would liaise with APG’s clients, take orders, give quotations, and meet with APG’s clients after work, on Saturdays or while she was on leave.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_n\"></a>(n)     The Wife paid for the family’s expenses without help from the Defendant, including car-related expenses for 5 cars purchased over 12 years and registered in the Husband’s name. The car-related expenses included monthly instalments, road tax, petrol, car park charges, insurance, ERP (or “Electronic Road Pricing”) charges and fines. The Wife paid for the expenses using her salary and the moneys in APG’s bank account.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_o\"></a>(o)     The Wife gave the parties’ son pocket money (on top of what the Husband was giving) all the way until the son was in National Service. The Wife also paid for the son’s toys and other items while he was growing up.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_p\"></a>(p)     When the Wife injured her spine in 2005, she had to pay for her surgery on her own. The Husband did not care for her after the surgery.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_q\"></a>(q)     In 2007, when the Husband told the Wife that his friend wanted to join APG for $25,000, the Wife agreed and transferred the business to the Husband’s name. However, the Husband did not pay the Wife for the business, even though she followed up with him a few times; the Husband kept telling the Wife that the business was not making money and he could not pay her.</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_19-p2_r\"></a>(r)     In 2009, when the parties’ son started attending secondary school, the Wife would send him to school. The Wife continued to send the son to school until he completed polytechnic education. She also sent him to his campsite, and sent him home when he booked out from camp, until he almost finished his National Service in 2019.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_20\"></a>20     In contrast, paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA1 merely contained particulars of the Husband’s direct and indirect financial contributions. The indirect contributions particularised in paragraph 19 of DA1 comprised the son’s school expenses, pocket money, handphone charges, and expenses for weekend meals and healthcare. The bulk of those expenses were incurred after the Wife was retrenched in January 2010. The Husband repeated those particulars at paragraphs 18 and 19 of DA2. Although the Husband stated at paragraph 21 of DA2 that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities during the course of [the parties’] marriage”, the Husband provided no details of his indirect non-financial contributions. The Husband did not deny any of the Wife’s statements concerning her indirect financial and non-financial contributions. The Husband in fact acknowledged the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions when he stated in paragraph 21 of DA2 that “both parties have expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son during the course of [the parties’] marriage”.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_21\"></a>21     The parties’ son made certain allegations concerning his upbringing in paragraph 6 of SA1. However, I disregarded those allegations, and similar allegations made by the Husband in paragraph 6 of DA4. To begin with, none of those allegations were relevant to the Wife’s applications for discovery and interrogatories, or to the Husband’s compliance with the orders made on 13 September 2024. Any allegations disputing the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions should have been contained in DA2, and should have been made within the time allowed by the Court for the filing of DA2 (i.e. by 29 February 2024). Those allegations appeared to be an attempt to introduce belatedly, without the permission of the Court, evidence that is designed to prejudice the Court against the Wife, on an occasion where the Wife had no opportunity to respond to those allegations.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_22\"></a>22     Having regard to the evidence contained in PA1, PA2, DA1 and DA2, it is clear that both parties have made indirect financial contributions over the course of the marriage. Given the course of time, and the lack of documentation, it will not be possible to say with certainty whether the Husband or the Wife made more indirect financial contributions. The Husband did not dispute the Wife’s contentions that she supported him and the family financially during the marriage. It appeared that the Husband stepped up after the Wife encountered difficulties with her health, employment and undertakings.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_23\"></a>23     However, the Wife appeared to have made significantly more indirect non-financial contributions than the Husband over the course of the marriage. For instance, the Wife appeared to have been the son’s main caregiver until the Wife started to drive a taxi full-time in 2011. The bulk of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions were made in the early years of the parties’ marriage, during the formative years of the parties’ son. The details of the Wife’s indirect non-financial contributions, which were asserted in paragraph 15 of PA1 and summarised at paragraphs 15 and 16 of the Plaintiff’s written submissions, were not denied by the Husband in DA2. The Husband made vague statements, such as that he had “devoted a lot of time and shared all caretaking responsibilities” and “expended huge efforts towards the upbringing of [the parties’] son”, but provided no particulars of his indirect non-financial contributions, in DA1 and DA2.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_24\"></a>24     All things considered, I assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_25\"></a>25     I agreed with the Wife’s submission that the Husband had failed to properly account for the total of $30,000 withdrawn from the Husband’s OCBC Account on 1 and 3 June 2023. The Husband did not explain how the documents exhibited at pages 5 to 13 of DA4 supported his claim that the withdrawals were made completely for the parties’ son, to help the son defray the son’s expenses. The exhibited documents did not suggest that the parties’ son was required to pay any amount of his tuition fees, or to repay any amount of his tuition fee loan, on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. Nor did the documents suggest that the son was required to pay any amount to the HDB for the son’s flat on or about 1 or 3 June 2023. The writ for divorce, statement of claim and statement of particulars were received by the Husband on 13 May 2023. The withdrawals were made just a few days before the Husband filed a Defence and Counterclaim on 7 June 2023, and appeared to be timed to reduce the amount of matrimonial assets available for distribution. Even if the son ultimately benefitted from the withdrawals made on 1 and 3 June 2023, that did not change the complexion of those withdrawals.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_26\"></a>26     However, I did not think I should make an arbitrary uplift of 3% in the Wife’s favour on account of the Husband’s failure. If the Husband had properly accounted for that sum of $30,000, it would have formed part of the Husband’s direct financial contributions to the pool of matrimonial assets, and enlarged the pool of matrimonial assets available for distribution.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_27\"></a>27     The parties arrived at the direct financial contributions ratio of 51.3 : 48.7 in the Husband’s favour on the basis that the Husband’s direct financial contributions amounted to $287,533.62 while the Wife’s direct financial contributions amounted to $272,785.35. If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the Husband’s direct financial contributions would increase to $317,533.62, or 53.8% of the parties’ total direct financial contributions of $590,318.97. The direct financial contribution ratio would then be 53.8 : 46.2 in the Husband’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_28\"></a>28     As I have assigned the parties’ indirect contributions the ratio of 60 : 40 in the Wife’s favour, after averaging the parties’ direct and indirect contributions, I would arrive at a final ratio of 53.1 : 46.9 in the Wife’s favour.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_29\"></a>29     If the sum of $30,000 was added back to the pool of matrimonial assets for the purpose of ascertaining the appropriate adjustment to the Wife’s share of the Joint Assets, then notionally the matrimonial assets available for distribution would be as follows:</p> <table align=\"left\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Judg-2-tblr\" frame=\"all\"

However, there were other expenses listed by the Husband that appeared reasonable. For instance, the Husband claimed, when DA2 was affirmed on 11 March 2024, that he was paying the following monthly expenses (which collectively would expend most of the Husband’s monthly take home salary): (a) $837 for the housing loan for the Matrimonial Home; (b) $67.50 for service and conservancy charges; (c) $40 for water; (d) $100 for electricity; (e) $13 for property tax; (f) $100 for transportation; (g) $450 for food and beverages; and (h) $300 for “Loan repayment on behalf of Plaintiff”.<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_26\" id=\"Ftn_26_1\"><sup>[note: 26]</sup></a></span></p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_44\"></a>44     It was not disputed that the Wife had borrowed at least $18,000 under a loan for which the Husband had acted as a guarantor, and that the Husband had made monthly repayments of $300 towards the loan, at least until 28 April 2023,<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_27\" id=\"Ftn_27_1\"><sup>[note: 27]</sup></a></span> before the Wife filed the writ for divorce.

However, the Husband declined to reciprocate when the Wife was in poor health and unable to work, primarily on the ground that he lacked the means to support her. While the amount to be paid by the Husband to the Wife for her share of the Matrimonial Home may go some way to meeting her expenses, a part of that amount would have to be refunded to her CPF accounts in accordance with the applicable CPF legislation, and another part of that amount would be required by her for alternative accommodation. I was mindful that both parties had limited financial resources. As the Husband claimed that his monthly expenses included a repayment of $300 a month towards the discharge of the loan taken by the Wife (for which the Husband was a guarantor), there would be no increase in the Husband’s monthly expenses if he was ordered to continue the monthly repayments, for a period of 2 years, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_48\"></a>48     Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular the matters listed in section 114(1)(<em>a</em>), (<em>b</em>), (<em>d</em>), (<em>e</em>) and (<em>f</em>) of the Women’s Charter 1961, I ordered the Defendant to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife, in satisfaction of the Wife’s claim for maintenance.</p> <p class=\"Judg-Heading-1\">Costs</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_49\"></a>49     At the hearing on 21 January 2025, the Wife’s counsel applied for the Husband to pay costs of $1,500 to $2,000, as the Court had agreed with the Wife’s submissions for indirect contributions and her claim for maintenance. The Wife’s counsel also sought costs for the original hearing of the ancillary matters on 18 December 2024, which had to be adjourned when the Husband’s counsel failed to attend the hearing. By a letter dated 18 December 2024 sent after the hearing, the Husband’s counsel apologised for his absence, and explained that due to an oversight following the departure of a paralegal, the Husband’s counsel was scheduled with 3 other matters (including a mediation at the State Courts) that clashed with the hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_50\"></a>50     The Husband’s counsel left the issue of costs to the Court. He pointed out that this was a “small family matter”, and asked for the costs of the adjournment to be awarded against him (instead of his client) as the adjournment was caused by his error.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_51\"></a>51     I am mindful that in <em>JBB v JBA</em> <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/Judgment/17741-SSP.xml')\">[2015] SGHCF 6</a>, <a class=\"pagecontent\" href=\"javascript:viewPageContent('/SLR/18024-SSP.xml')\">[2015] 5 SLR 153</a>, at [32] and [33], the Family Division of the High Court observed that there are usually good reasons in the context of matrimonial proceedings to depart from the guiding principle that costs should follow the event. Citing rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force at the time that <em>JBB v JBA</em> was decided), the Court also observed that the principle that costs should follow the event may be departed from where it is appropriate to do so. In the context of divorce proceedings, the Court gave as examples (of when this would be appropriate) cases where the judgment of divorce was obtained based on a “neutral” fact such as “living apart” or upon compromise by the parties to proceed on an uncontested basis (whatever the fact relied on), or where an order of costs would aggravate the acrimony between the parties and it was important in the circumstances to reduce the risk of increasing hostility. The Court also observed that in the context of the hearing of ancillary matters (which may be considered to be discrete from the divorce proceedings), it is the conduct of the parties in the proceedings which will have greater relevance in the exercise of the discretion in determining costs, and that a party who has been uncooperative in disclosing his or her assets and means would be unlikely to receive a favourable costs order.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_52\"></a>52     Under rule 852(2) of the Family Justice Rules 2014 (as in force immediately before 15 October 2024),<span class=\"FootnoteRef\"><a href=\"#Ftn_29\" id=\"Ftn_29_1\"><sup>[note: 29]</sup></a></span> if the Court in its discretion sees fit to make any order as to the costs of or incidental to any proceedings, the Court shall order the costs to follow the event, except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made. The hearing of the ancillary matters before me was not one to which any of the usual reasons (for departing from the principle that costs should follow the event) applied. As the Wife had substantially succeeded in obtaining the share of the Joint Assets that she was seeking, and as the Husband was also ordered to repay $300 a month for a period of 2 years towards the discharge of the loan taken out by the Wife in satisfaction of Wife’s claim for maintenance, the Wife was the successful party at the hearing of the ancillary matters, and should therefore in principle be awarded the costs of that hearing.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_53\"></a>53     For the hearing of the ancillary matters, the Wife and the Husband filed 2 affidavits each. These were:</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_a\"></a>(a)     PA1 (16 pages of statements and 126 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_b\"></a>(b)     PA2 (5 pages of statements and 6 pages of exhibits);</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_c\"></a>(c)     DA1 (7 pages of statements and 174 pages of exhibits); and</p> <p class=\"Judg-2\"><a id=\"p1_53-p2_d\"></a>(d)     DA2 (8 pages of statements and 87 pages of exhibits).</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_54\"></a>54     The main hearing of the ancillary matters on 14 January 2025 lasted from 2:30 pm to 3:13 pm. The short hearing was made possible by the prior filing of a 14-page written submission on behalf of the Wife (the page count excludes the cover page, the table of contents and the Annex to the written submissions) and a 13-page written submission on behalf of the Husband (the page count excludes the cover page). This was followed by a hearing on 21 January 2025 lasting from 8:30 am to 9:35 am, at which I delivered an oral judgment and received submissions on the form that the order for maintenance should take and on costs.</p> <p class=\"Judg-1\"><a id=\"p1_55\"></a>55     All things considered, I ordered the Husband to pay the Wife the costs of the ancillary matters fixed at $1,500 all in. I also ordered the Husband’s counsel to personally bear the costs of adjournment on 18 December 2024, fixed at $100.</p> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_1_1\" id=\"Ftn_1\">[note: 1]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 2.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_2_1\" id=\"Ftn_2\">[note: 2]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraphs 2 and 6(b), and DA2 paragraphs 2 and 6(b).</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_3_1\" id=\"Ftn_3\">[note: 3]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3 and Annex A, DA1 paragraph 3, and DA2 paragraph 3.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_4_1\" id=\"Ftn_4\">[note: 4]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraphs 3 and 4 and Annexes A and D.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_5_1\" id=\"Ftn_5\">[note: 5]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex C, DA1 paragraph 12, and DA2 paragraph 12.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_6_1\" id=\"Ftn_6\">[note: 6]</a></sup>See PA1 Section A paragraph 3, Section B paragraph 8 and Annex B.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_7_1\" id=\"Ftn_7\">[note: 7]</a></sup>See PA1 Section B paragraph 9 and Annex F.</p><p class=\"Footnote\"><sup><a href=\"#Ftn_8_1\" id=\"Ftn_8\">[note: 8]</a></sup>See DA1 paragraph 12.
